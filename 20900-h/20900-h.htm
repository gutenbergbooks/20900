<h2>EDITOR’S PREFACE</h2>


<p>In editing the present volume I have thought it
well to follow the same rule which I laid down for
myself in editing <i>The Study of Words</i>, and have
made no alteration in the text of Dr. Trench’s
work (the fifth edition). Any corrections or additions
that seemed to be demanded owing to the
progress of lexicographical knowledge have been
reserved for the foot-notes, and these can always
be distinguished from those in the original by the
square brackets [thus] within which they are placed.</p>

<p>On the whole more corrections have been required
in <i>English Past and Present</i> than in <i>The
Study of Words</i> owing to the sweeping statements
which involve universal negatives&mdash;statements,
e.g. that certain words either first came into use,
or ceased to be employed, at a specific date.
Nothing short of the combined researches of an
army of co-operative workers, such as the <i>New
English Dictionary</i> commanded, could warrant the
correctness of assertions of this kind, which imply
an exhaustive acquaintance with a subject so immense
as the entire range of English literature.</p>

<p>Even the mistakes of a learned man are instructive
to those who essay to follow in his steps, and
it is not without use to point them out instead of
ignoring or expunging them. Thus, when the
Archbishop falls into the error (venial when he
wrote) of assuming an etymological connexion
between certain words which have a specious air
of kinship&mdash;such as ‘care’ and ‘cura,’ ‘bloom’
and ‘blossom,’ ‘ghastly’ and ‘ghostly,’
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>‘brat’ and ‘brood,’ ‘slow’ and ‘slough’&mdash;he
makes just the mistakes which we would be
tempted to make ourselves had not Professor
Skeat and Dr. Murray and the great German
School of philologists taught us to know better.
Our plan, therefore, has been to leave such errors in
the text and point out the better way in the notes.
In other words, we have treated the Archbishop’s
work as a classic, and the occasional emendations
in the notes serve to mark the progress of half a
century of etymological investigation. It is hardly
necessary to point out that the chronological landmarks
occurring here and there need an obvious
equation of time to make them correct for the
present year of grace, e.g. ‘lately,’ when it occurs,
must be understood to mean at least fifty years ago,
and a similar addition must be made to other
time-points when they present themselves.</p>

<h2><a name="PREFACE_TO_THE_FIRST_EDITION" id="PREFACE_TO_THE_FIRST_EDITION"></a>PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION</h2>


<p>A series of four lectures which I delivered last
spring to the pupils of the King’s College School,
London, supplied the foundation to this present
volume. These lectures, which I was obliged to
prepare in haste, on a brief invitation, and under
the pressure of other engagements, being subsequently
enlarged and recast, were delivered in the
autumn somewhat more nearly in their present
shape to the pupils of the Training School, Winchester;
with only those alterations, omissions
and additions, which the difference in my hearers
suggested as necessary or desirable. I have found
it convenient to keep the lectures, as regards the
persons presumed to be addressed, in that earlier
form which I had sketched out at the first; and,
inasmuch as it helps much to keep lectures vivid
and real that one should have some well defined
audience, if not actually before one, yet before the
mind’s eye, to suppose myself throughout addressing
my first hearers. I have supposed myself, that
is, addressing a body of young Englishmen, all with
a fair amount of classical knowledge (in my explanations
I have sometimes had others with less
than theirs in my eye), not wholly unacquainted
with modern languages; but not yet with any
special designation as to their future work; having
only as yet marked out to them the duty in general
of living lives worthy of those who have England<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
for their native country, and English for their
native tongue. To lead such through a more intimate
knowledge of this into a greater love of that,
has been a principal aim which I have set before
myself throughout.</p>

<p>In a few places I have been obliged again to go
over ground which I had before gone over in a
little book, <i>On the Study of Words</i>; but I believe
that I have never merely repeated myself, nor
given to the readers of my former work and now
of this any right to complain that I am compelling
them to travel a second time by the same paths.
At least it has been my endeavour, whenever I
have found myself at points where the two books
come necessarily into contact, that what was
treated with any fulness before, should be here
touched on more lightly; and only what there was
slightly handled, should here be entered on at large.</p>

<h3>ENGLISH A COMPOSITE LANGUAGE</h3>


<p>“A very slight acquaintance with the history
of our own language will teach us that the speech
of Chaucer’s age is not the speech of Skelton’s, that
there is a great difference between the language
under Elizabeth and that under Charles the
First, between that under Charles the First and
Charles the Second, between that under Charles
the Second and Queen Anne; that considerable
changes had taken place between the beginning
and the middle of the last century, and that
Johnson and Fielding did not write altogether
as we do now. For in the course of a nation’s
progress new ideas are evermore mounting above
the horizon, while others are lost sight of and
sink below it: others again change their form and
aspect: others which seemed united, split into
parts. And as it is with ideas, so it is with their
symbols, words. New ones are perpetually coined<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
to meet the demand of an advanced understanding,
of new feelings that have sprung out of the
decay of old ones, of ideas that have shot forth
from the summit of the tree of our knowledge;
old words meanwhile fall into disuse and become
obsolete; others have their meaning narrowed
and defined; synonyms diverge from each other
and their property is parted between them; nay,
whole classes of words will now and then be thrown
overboard, as new feelings or perceptions of
analogy gain ground. A history of the language
in which all these vicissitudes should be pointed
out, in which the introduction of every new word
should be noted, so far as it is possible&mdash;and
much may be done in this way by laborious and
diligent and judicious research&mdash;in which such
words as have become obsolete should be followed
down to their final extinction, in which all the
most remarkable words should be traced through
their successive phases of meaning, and in which
moreover the causes and occasions of these changes
should be explained, such a work would not only
abound in entertainment, but would throw more
light on the development of the human mind
than all the brainspun systems of metaphysics
that ever were written”.</p>

<hr class="small" />

<p>These words, which thus far are not my own,
but the words of a greatly honoured friend and
teacher, who, though we behold him now no
more, still teaches, and will teach, by the wisdom
of his writings, and the nobleness of his life (they
are words of Archdeacon Hare), I have put in
the forefront of my lectures; seeing that they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
anticipate in the way of masterly sketch all which
I shall attempt to accomplish, and indeed draw
out the lines of much more, to which I shall not
venture so much as to put my hand. They are
the more welcome to me, because they encourage
me to believe that if, in choosing the English
language, its past and its present, as the subject
of that brief course of lectures which I am to
deliver in this place, I have chosen a subject
which in many ways transcends my powers, and
lies beyond the range of my knowledge, it is yet one
in itself of deepest interest, and of fully recognized
value. Nor can I refrain from hoping that
even with my imperfect handling, it is an argument
which will find an answer and an echo in the
hearts of all who hear me; which would have
found this at any time; which will do so especially
at the present. For these are times which naturally
rouse into liveliest activity all our latent
affections for the land of our birth. It is one
of the compensations, indeed the greatest of all,
for the wastefulness, the woe, the cruel losses of
war<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>, that it causes and indeed compels a people
to know itself a people; leading each one to
esteem and prize most that which he has in common
with his fellow countrymen, and not now any
longer those things which separate and divide
him from them.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Love of our own Tongue</i></div>

<p>And the love of our own language, what is it in
fact, but the love of our country expressing
itself in one particular direction? If the great<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
acts of that nation to which we belong are precious
to us, if we feel ourselves made greater by their
greatness, summoned to a nobler life by the
nobleness of Englishmen who have already lived
and died, and have bequeathed to us a name
which must not by us be made less, what exploits
of theirs can well be nobler, what can more clearly
point out their native land and ours as having
fulfilled a glorious past, as being destined for a
glorious future, than that they should have
acquired for themselves and for those who come
after them a clear, a strong, an harmonious, a
noble language? For all this bears witness to
corresponding merits in those that speak it, to
clearness of mental vision, to strength, to harmony,
to nobleness in them that have gradually formed
and shaped it to be the utterance of their inmost
life and being.</p>

<p>To know of this language, the stages which it
has gone through, the sources from which its
riches have been derived, the gains which it is now
making, the perils which have threatened or are
threatening it, the losses which it has sustained,
the capacities which may be yet latent in it,
waiting to be evoked, the points in which it transcends
other tongues, in which it comes short of
them, all this may well be the object of worthy
ambition to every one of us. So may we hope to
be ourselves guardians of its purity, and not
corrupters of it; to introduce, it may be, others
into an intelligent knowledge of that, with which
we shall have ourselves more than a merely superficial
acquaintance; to bequeath it to those who
come after us not worse than we received it our<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>selves.
“Spartam nactus es; hanc exorna”,&mdash;this
should be our motto in respect at once of our
country, and of our country’s tongue.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Duty to our own Tongue</i></div>

<p>Nor shall we, I trust, any of us feel this subject
to be alien or remote from the purposes which
have brought us to study within these walls. It
is true that we are mainly occupied here in
studying other tongues than our own. The time
we bestow upon it is small as compared with that
bestowed on those others. And yet one of our
main purposes in learning them is that we may
better understand this. Nor ought any other to
dispute with it the first and foremost place in our
reverence, our gratitude, and our love. It has
been well and worthily said by an illustrious German
scholar: “The care of the national language
I consider as at all times a sacred trust and a most
important privilege of the higher orders of society.
Every man of education should make it the object
of his unceasing concern, to preserve his language
pure and entire, to speak it, so far as is in his
power, in all its beauty and perfection....
A nation whose language becomes rude and
barbarous, must be on the brink of barbarism in
regard to everything else. A nation which allows
her language to go to ruin, is parting with the last
half of her intellectual independence, and testifies
her willingness to cease to exist”<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>.</p>

<p>But this knowledge, like all other knowledge
which is worth attaining, is only to be attained
at the price of labour and pains. The language
which at this day we speak is the result of pro<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>cesses
which have been going forward for hundreds
and for thousands of years. Nay more, it is not
too much to affirm that processes modifying the
English which at the present day we write and
speak have been at work from the first day that
man, being gifted with discourse of reason, projected
his thought from out himself, and embodied
and contemplated it in his word. Which things
being so, if we would understand this language
as it now is, we must know something of it as it
has been; we must be able to measure, however
roughly, the forces, which have been at work upon
it, moulding and shaping it into the forms which
it now wears.</p>

<p>At the same time various prudential considerations
must determine for us how far up we will
endeavour to trace the course of its history. There
are those who may seek to trace our language to the
forests of Germany and Scandinavia, to investigate
its relation to all the kindred tongues that
were there spoken; again, to follow it up, till it
and they are seen descending from an elder stock;
nor once to pause, till they have assigned to it its
place not merely in respect of that small group of
languages which are immediately round it, but in
respect of all the tongues and languages of the
earth. I can imagine few studies of a more surpassing
interest than this. Others, however, must
be content with seeking such insight into their
native language as may be within the reach of all
who, unable to make this the subject of especial
research, possessing neither that vast compass
of knowledge, nor that immense apparatus of
books, not being at liberty to dedicate to it that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
devotion almost of a life which, followed out to
the full, it would require, have yet an intelligent
interest in their mother tongue, and desire to
learn as much of its growth and history and
construction as may be reasonably deemed within
their reach. To such as these I shall suppose
myself to be speaking. It would be a piece of
great presumption in me to undertake to speak to
any other, or to assume any other ground than
this for myself.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>The Past explains the Present</i></div>

<p>I know there are some, who, when they are
invited to enter at all upon the past history of the
language, are inclined to make answer&mdash;“To what
end such studies to us? Why cannot we leave
them to a few antiquaries and grammarians?
Sufficient to us to know the laws of our present
English, to obtain an accurate acquaintance with
the language as we now find it, without concerning
ourselves with the phases through which it has
previously past”. This may sound plausible
enough; and I can quite understand a real lover
of his native tongue, who has not bestowed
much thought upon the subject, arguing in this
manner. And yet indeed such argument proceeds
altogether on a mistake. One sufficient reason
why we should occupy ourselves with the past of
our language is, because the present is only intelligible
in the light of the past, often of a very remote
past indeed. There are anomalies out of number
now existing in our language, which the pure logic
of grammar is quite incapable of explaining;
which nothing but a knowledge of its historic
evolutions, and of the disturbing forces which have
made themselves felt therein, will ever enable us<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
to understand. Even as, again, unless we possess
some knowledge of the past, it is impossible that
we can ourselves advance a single step in the
unfolding of the latent capabilities of the language,
without the danger of committing some barbarous
violation of its very primary laws.</p>

<hr class="small" />

<p>The plan which I have laid down for myself,
and to which I shall adhere, in this lecture and in
those which will succeed it, is as follows. In this
my first lecture I will ask you to consider the
language as now it is, to decompose with me some
specimens of it, to prove by these means, of what
elements it is compact, and what functions in it
these elements or component parts severally
fulfil; nor shall I leave this subject without asking
you to admire the happy marriage in our tongue of
the languages of the north and south, an advantage
which it alone among all the languages of Europe
enjoys. Having thus presented to ourselves the
body which we wish to submit to scrutiny,
and having become acquainted, however slightly,
with its composition, I shall invite you to go back
with me, and trace some of the leading changes to
which in time past it has been submitted, and
through which it has arrived at what it now is; and
these changes I shall contemplate under four
aspects, dedicating a lecture to each;&mdash;changes
which have resulted from the birth of new, or the
reception of foreign, words;&mdash;changes consequent
on the rejection or extinction of words or powers
once possessed by the language;&mdash;changes through
the altered meaning of words;&mdash;and lastly, as not
unworthy of our attention, but often growing out<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
of very deep roots, changes in the orthography of
words.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Alterations unobserved</i></div>

<p>I shall everywhere seek to bring the subject
down to our present time, and not merely call your
attention to the changes which have been, but to
those also which are now being, effected. I shall
not account the fact that some are going on, so to
speak, before our own eyes, a sufficient ground to
excuse me from noticing them, but rather an additional
reason for doing this. For indeed changes
which are actually proceeding in our own time,
and which we are ourselves helping to bring about,
are the very ones which we are most likely to fail
in observing. There is so much to hide the nature
of them, and indeed their very existence, that,
except it may be by a very few, they will often
pass wholly unobserved. Loud and sudden revolutions
attract and compel notice; but silent and
gradual, although with issues far vaster in store,
run their course, and it is only when their cycle
is completed or nearly so, that men perceive what
mighty transforming forces have been at work
unnoticed in the very midst of themselves.</p>

<p>Thus, to apply what I have just affirmed to this
matter of language&mdash;how few aged persons, let
them retain the fullest possession of their faculties,
are conscious of any difference between the spoken
language of their early youth, and that of their old
age; that words and ways of using words are
obsolete now, which were usual then; that many
words are current now, which had no existence at
that time. And yet it is certain that so it must be.
A man may fairly be supposed to remember clearly
and well for sixty years back; and it needs less<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
than five of these sixties to bring us to the period
of Spenser, and not more than eight to set us in
the time of Chaucer and Wiclif. How great a
change, what vast modifications in our language,
within eight memories. No one, contemplating
this whole term, will deny the immensity of the
change. For all this, we may be tolerably sure
that, had it been possible to interrogate a series
of eight persons, such as together had filled up
this time, intelligent men, but men whose attention
had not been especially roused to this subject,
each in his turn would have denied that there had
been any change worth speaking of, perhaps any
change at all, during his lifetime. And yet,
having regard to the multitude of words which
have fallen into disuse during these four or five
hundred years, we are sure that there must have
been some lives in this chain which saw those
words in use at their commencement, and out of
use before their close. And so too, of the multitude
of words which have sprung up in this period,
some, nay, a vast number, must have come into
being within the limits of each of these lives. It
cannot then be superfluous to direct attention to
that which is actually going forward in our language.
It is indeed that, which of all is most
likely to be unobserved by us.</p>

<hr class="small" />

<p>With these preliminary remarks I proceed at
once to the special subject of my lecture of to-day.
And first, starting from the recognized fact that
the English is not a simple but a composite language,
made up of several elements, as are the
people who speak it, I would suggest to you the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
profit and instruction which we might derive from
seeking to resolve it into its component parts&mdash;from
taking, that is, any passage of an English
author, distributing the words of which it is made
up according to the languages from which they
are drawn; estimating the relative numbers and
proportions, which these languages have severally
lent us; as well as the character of the words
which they have thrown into the common stock
of our tongue.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Proportions in English</i></div>

<p>Thus, suppose the English language to be divided
into a hundred parts; of these, to make a rough
distribution, sixty would be Saxon; thirty would
be Latin (including of course the Latin which has
come to us through the French); five would be
Greek. We should thus have assigned ninety-five
parts, leaving the other five, perhaps too large a
residue, to be divided among all the other languages
from which we have adopted isolated
words<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>. And yet these are not few; from our
wide extended colonial empire we come in contact
with half the world; we have picked up words
<ins class="correction" title="missing ‘i’ in original">in</ins> every quarter, and, the English language
possessing a singular power of incorporating
foreign elements into itself, have not scrupled to
make many of these our own<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Oriental Words</i></div>

<p>Thus we have a certain number of Hebrew
words, mostly, if not entirely, belonging to religious
matters, as ‘amen’, ‘cabala’, ‘cherub’, ‘ephod’,
‘gehenna’, ‘hallelujah’, ‘hosanna’, ‘jubilee’,
‘leviathan’, ‘manna’, ‘Messiah’, ‘sabbath’,
‘Satan’, ‘seraph’, ‘shibboleth’, ‘talmud’. The
Arabic words in our language are more numerous;
we have several arithmetical and astronomical
terms, as ‘algebra’, ‘almanack’, ‘azimuth’,
‘cypher’<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>, ‘nadir’, ‘talisman’, ‘zenith’, ‘zero’;
and chemical, for the Arabs were the chemists,
no less than the astronomers and arithmeticians
of the middle ages; as ‘alcohol’, ‘alembic’,
‘alkali’, ‘elixir’. Add to these the names of
animals, plants, fruits, or articles of merchandize
first introduced by them to the notice of Western
Europe; as ‘amber’, ‘artichoke’, ‘barragan’,
‘camphor’, ‘coffee’, ‘cotton’, ‘crimson’,
‘gazelle’, ‘giraffe’, ‘jar’, ‘jasmin’, ‘lake’
(lacca), ‘lemon’, ‘lime’, ‘lute’, ‘mattress’,
‘mummy’, ‘saffron’, ‘sherbet’, ‘shrub’, ‘sofa’,
‘sugar’, ‘syrup’, ‘tamarind’; and some further
terms, ‘admiral’, ‘amulet’, ‘arsenal’, ‘assassin’,
‘barbican’, ‘caliph’, ‘caffre’, ‘carat’, ‘divan’,
‘dragoman’<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>, ‘emir’, ‘fakir’, ‘firman’,
‘harem<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>’,
‘hazard’, ‘houri’, ‘magazine’, ‘mamaluke’,
‘minaret’, ‘monsoon’, ‘mosque’, ‘nabob’,
‘razzia’, ‘sahara’, ‘simoom’, ‘sirocco’, ‘sultan’,
‘tarif’, ‘vizier’; and I believe we shall
have nearly completed the list. We have moreover
a few Persian words, as ‘azure’, ‘bazaar’,
‘bezoar’, ‘caravan’, ‘caravanserai’, ‘chess’,
‘dervish’, ‘lilac’, ‘orange’, ‘saraband’, ‘taffeta’,
‘tambour’, ‘turban’; this last appearing
in strange forms at its first introduction into the
language, thus ‘tolibant’ (Puttenham), ‘tulipant’
(Herbert’s <i>Travels</i>), ‘turribant’ (Spenser),
‘turbat’, ‘turbant’, and at length ‘turban’.
We have also a few Turkish, such as ‘chouse’,
‘janisary’, ‘odalisque’, ‘sash’, ‘tulip’<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>. Of
‘civet’<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> and
‘scimitar’<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> I believe it can only be
asserted that they are Eastern. The following
are Hindostanee, ‘avatar’, ‘bungalow’, ‘calico’,
‘chintz’, ‘cowrie’, ‘lac’, ‘muslin’, ‘punch’,
‘rupee’, ‘toddy’. ‘Tea’, or ‘tcha’, as it was
spelt at first, of course is Chinese, so too are ‘junk’
and ‘satin’<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>.</p>

<p>The New World has given us a certain number<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
of words, Indian and other&mdash;‘cacique’ (‘cassique’,
in Ralegh’s <i>Guiana</i>), ‘canoo’, ‘chocolate’,
‘cocoa’<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>, ‘condor’, ‘hamoc’ (‘hamaca’ in Ralegh),
‘jalap’, ‘lama’, ‘maize’ (Haytian), ‘pampas’,
‘pemmican’, ‘potato’ (‘batata’ in our earlier
voyagers), ‘raccoon’, ‘sachem’, ‘squaw’, ‘tobacco’,
‘tomahawk’, ‘tomata’ (Mexican), ‘wigwam’.
If ‘hurricane’ is a word which Europe
originally obtained from the Caribbean islanders<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>,
it should of course be included in this list<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>. A
certain number of words also we have received,
one by one, from various languages, which sometimes
have not bestowed on us more than this
single one. Thus ‘hussar’ is Hungarian; ‘caloyer’,
Romaic; ‘mammoth’, of some Siberian
language;<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> ‘tattoo’, Polynesian; ‘steppe’,
Tartarian; ‘sago’, ‘bamboo’, ‘rattan’, ‘ourang
outang’, are all, I believe, Malay words; ‘assegai’<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>
‘zebra’, ‘chimpanzee’,
‘<ins class="correction" title="so in original">fetisch</ins>’, belong to
different African dialects; the last, however, having
reached Europe through the channel of the
Portuguese<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Italian Words</i></div>

<p>To come nearer home&mdash;we have a certain
num<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>ber
of Italian words, as ‘balcony’, ‘baldachin’,
‘balustrade’, ‘bandit’, ‘bravo’, ‘bust’ (it was
‘busto’ as first used in English, and therefore
from the Italian, not from the French), ‘cameo’,
‘canto’, ‘caricature’, ‘carnival’, ‘cartoon’,
‘charlatan’, ‘concert’, ‘conversazione’, ‘cupola’,
‘ditto’, ‘doge’, ‘domino’<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>, ‘felucca’, ‘fresco’,
‘gazette’, ‘generalissimo’, ‘gondola’, ‘gonfalon’,
‘grotto’, (‘grotta’ is the earliest form in which
we have it in English), ‘gusto’, ‘harlequin’<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>,
‘imbroglio’, ‘inamorato’, ‘influenza’, ‘lava’,
‘malaria’, ‘manifesto’, ‘masquerade’ (‘mascarata’
in Hacket), ‘motto’, ‘nuncio’, ‘opera’,
‘oratorio’, ‘pantaloon’, ‘parapet’, ‘pedantry’,
‘pianoforte’, ‘piazza’, ‘portico’, ‘proviso’, ‘regatta’,
‘ruffian’, ‘scaramouch’, ‘sequin’,
‘seraglio’, ‘sirocco’, ‘sonnet’, ‘stanza’, ‘stiletto’,
‘stucco’, ‘studio’, ‘terra-cotta’, ‘umbrella’,
‘virtuoso’, ‘vista’, ‘volcano’, ‘zany’.
‘Becco’, and ‘cornuto’, ‘fantastico’, ‘magnifico’,
‘impress’ (the armorial device upon shields, and
appearing constantly in its Italian form ‘impresa’),
‘saltimbanco’ (=&nbsp;mountebank), all once
common enough, are now obsolete. Sylvester
uses often ‘farfalla’ for butterfly, but, as far as I
know, this use is peculiar to him.

<span class="sidenote"><i>Spanish, Dutch and Celtic Words</i></span>

If these are at
all the whole number of our Italian words, and
I cannot call to mind any other, the Spanish in the
language are nearly as numerous; nor indeed
would it be wonderful if they were more so;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
our points of contact with Spain, friendly and
hostile, have been much more real than with Italy.
Thus we have from the Spanish ‘albino’, ‘alligator’
(<ins class="correction" title="removed spurious quote mark after ‘lagarto’">el lagarto</ins>),
‘alcove’<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>, ‘armada’, ‘armadillo’,
‘barricade’, ‘bastinado’, ‘bravado’, ‘caiman’,
‘cambist’, ‘camisado’, ‘carbonado’,
‘cargo’, ‘cigar’, ‘cochineal’, ‘Creole’, ‘desperado’,
‘don’, ‘duenna’, ‘eldorado’, ‘embargo’,
‘flotilla’, ‘gala’, ‘grandee’, ‘grenade’, ‘guerilla’,
‘hooker’<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>, ‘infanta’, ‘jennet’, ‘junto’, ‘merino’,
‘mosquito’, ‘mulatto’, ‘negro’, ‘olio’, ‘ombre’,
‘palaver’, ‘parade’, ‘parasol’, ‘parroquet’,
‘peccadillo’, ‘picaroon’, ‘platina’, ‘poncho’,
‘punctilio’, (for a long time spelt ‘puntillo’,
in English books), ‘quinine’, ‘reformado’,
‘savannah’, ‘serenade’, ‘sherry’, ‘stampede’,
‘stoccado’, ‘strappado’, ‘tornado’, ‘vanilla’,
‘verandah’. ‘Buffalo’ also is Spanish; ‘buff’
or ‘buffle’ being the proper English word;
‘caprice’ too we probably obtained rather from
Spain than Italy, as we find it written ‘capricho’
by those who used it first. Other Spanish words,
once familiar, are now extinct. ‘Punctilio’ lives
on, but not ‘punto’, which occurs in Bacon.
‘Privado’, signifying a prince’s favourite, one
admitted to his <i>privacy</i> (no uncommon word in
Jeremy Taylor and Fuller), has quite disappeared;
so too has ‘quirpo’ (cuerpo), the name given to a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
jacket fitting close to the <i>body</i>; ‘quellio’ (cuello),
a ruff or <i>neck</i>-collar; and ‘matachin’, the title of a
sword-dance; these are all frequent in our early
dramatists; and ‘flota’ was the constant name
of the treasure-fleet from the Indies. ‘Intermess’
is employed by Evelyn, and is the Spanish ‘entremes’,
though not recognized as such in our
dictionaries. ‘Mandarin’ and ‘marmalade’ are
our only Portuguese words I can call to mind. A
good many of our sea-terms are Dutch, as ‘sloop’,
‘schooner’, ‘yacht’, ‘boom’, ‘skipper’, ‘tafferel’,
‘to smuggle’; ‘to wear’, in the sense of veer, as
when we say ‘<i>to wear</i> a ship’; ‘skates’, too, and
‘stiver’, are Dutch. Celtic <i>things</i> are for the most
part designated among us by Celtic words; such
as ‘bard’, ‘kilt’, ‘clan’, ‘pibroch’, ‘plaid’,
‘reel’. Nor only such as these, which are all of
them comparatively of modern introduction, but a
considerable number, how large a number is yet a
very unsettled question, of words which at a much
earlier date found admission into our tongue, are
derived from this quarter.</p>

<p>Now, of course, I have no right to presume that
any among us are equipped with that knowledge
of other tongues, which shall enable us to detect of
ourselves and at once the nationality of all or most
of the words which we may meet&mdash;some of them
greatly disguised, and having undergone manifold
transformations in the process of their adoption
among us; but only that we have such helps at
command in the shape of dictionaries and the
like, and so much diligence in their use, as will
enable us to discover the quarter from which the
words we may encounter have reached us; and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
I will confidently say that few studies of the
kind will be more fruitful, will suggest more various
matter of reflection, will more lead you into the
secrets of the English tongue, than an analysis of
a certain number of passages drawn from different
authors, such as I have just now proposed. For
this analysis you will take some passage of English
verse or prose&mdash;say the first ten lines of <i>Paradise
Lost</i>&mdash;or the Lord’s Prayer&mdash;or the 23rd Psalm;
you will distribute the whole body of words contained
in that passage, of course not omitting the
smallest, according to their nationalities&mdash;writing,
it may be, A over every Anglo-Saxon word, L
over every Latin, and so on with the others, if
any other should occur in the portion which you
have submitted to this examination. When this
is done, you will count up the <i>number</i> of those
which each language contributes; again, you will
note the <i>character</i> of the words derived from each
quarter.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Two Shapes of Words</i></div>

<p>Yet here, before I pass further, I would observe
in respect of those which come from the Latin, that
it will be desirable further to mark whether they
are directly from it, and such might be marked L&sup1;,
or only mediately from it, and to us directly from
the French, which would be L&sup2;, or L at second
hand&mdash;our English word being only in the second
generation descended from the Latin, not the child,
but the child’s child. There is a rule that holds
pretty constantly good, by which you may determine
this point. It is this,&mdash;that if a word be
directly from the Latin, it will not have undergone
any alteration or modification in its form and
shape, save only in the termination&mdash;‘innocentia’
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>will have become ‘innocency’, ‘natio’ will
have become ‘nation’, ‘firmamentum’ ‘firmament’,
but nothing more. On the other hand,
if it comes <i>through</i> the French, it will generally be
considerably altered in its passage. It will have
undergone a process of lubrication; its sharply
defined Latin outline will in good part have departed
from it; thus ‘crown’ is from ‘corona’,
but though ‘couronne’, and itself a dissyllable,
‘coroune’, in our earlier English; ‘treasure’
is from ‘thesaurus’, but through ‘trésor’; ‘emperor’
is the Latin ‘imperator’, but it was first
‘empereur’. It will often happen that the
substantive has past through this process, having
reached us through the intervention of the French;
while we have only felt at a later period our want
of the adjective also, which we have proceeded
to borrow direct from the Latin. Thus, ‘people’
is indeed ‘populus’, but it was ‘peuple’ first,
while ‘popular’ is a direct transfer of a Latin
vocable into our English glossary. So too ‘enemy’
is ‘inimicus’, but it was first softened in the
French, and had its Latin physiognomy to a great
degree obliterated, while ‘inimical’ is Latin
throughout; ‘parish’ is ‘paroisse’, but ‘parochial’
is ‘parochialis’; ‘chapter’ is ‘chapitre’,
but ‘capitular’ is ‘capitularis’.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Doublets</i></div>

<p>Sometimes you will find in English what I may
call the double adoption of a Latin word; which
now makes part of our vocabulary in two shapes;
‘doppelgängers’ the Germans would call such
words<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>.
There is first the elder word, which
the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
French has given us; but which, before it gave, it
had fashioned and moulded, cutting it short, it
may be, by a syllable or more, for the French
devours letters and syllables; and there is the
later word which we borrowed immediately from
the Latin. I will mention a few examples; ‘secure’
and ‘sure’, both from ‘securus’, but one
directly, the other through the French; ‘fidelity’
and ‘fealty’, both from ‘fidelitas’, but one
directly, the other at second-hand; ‘species’
and ‘spice’, both from ‘species’, spices being
properly only <i>kinds</i> of aromatic drugs; ‘blaspheme’
and ‘blame’, both from ‘blasphemare’<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>, but
‘blame’ immediately from ‘blâmer’. Add to
these ‘granary’ and ‘garner’; ‘captain’ (capitaneus)
and ‘chieftain’; ‘tradition’ and ‘treason’;
‘abyss’ and ‘abysm’; ‘regal’ and
‘royal’; ‘legal’ and ‘loyal’; ‘cadence’ and
‘chance’; ‘balsam’ and ‘balm’; ‘hospital’ and
‘hotel’; ‘digit’ and ‘doit’<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>; ‘pagan’ and ‘paynim’;
‘captive’ and ‘caitiff’; ‘persecute’ and
‘pursue’; ‘superficies’ and ‘surface’; ‘faction’
and ‘fashion’; ‘particle’ and ‘parcel’; ‘redemption’
and ‘ransom’; ‘probe’ and ‘prove’; ‘abbreviate’
and ‘abridge’; ‘dormitory’ and ‘dortoir’
or ‘dorter’ (this last now obsolete, but not
uncommon in Jeremy Taylor); ‘desiderate’ and
‘desire’; ‘fact’ and ‘feat’; ‘major’ and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
‘mayor’; ‘radius’ and ‘ray’; ‘pauper’ and
‘poor’; ‘potion’ and ‘poison’; ‘ration’ and
‘reason’; ‘oration’ and ‘orison’<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>. I have,
in the instancing of these named always the Latin
form before the French; but the reverse I suppose
in every instance is the order in which the words
were adopted by us; we had ‘pursue’ before
‘persecute’, ‘spice’ before ‘species’, ‘royalty’
before ‘regality’, and so with the others<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>.</p>

<p>The explanation of this greater change which
the earlier form of the word has undergone, is not
far to seek. Words which have been introduced<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
into a language at an early period, when as yet
writing is rare, and books are few or none, when
therefore orthography is unfixed, or being purely
phonetic, cannot properly be said to exist at all,
such words for a long while live orally on the lips of
men, before they are set down in writing; and out
of this fact it is that we shall for the most part find
them reshaped and remoulded by the people who
have adopted them, entirely assimilated to <i>their</i>
language in form and termination, so as in a little
while to be almost or quite indistinguishable from
natives. On the other hand a most effectual check
to this process, a process sometimes barbarizing
and defacing, however it may be the only one which
will make the newly brought in entirely homogeneous
with the old and already existing, is
imposed by the existence of a much written language
and a full formed literature. The foreign
word, being once adopted into these, can no longer
undergo a thorough transformation. For the
most part the utmost which use and familiarity
can do with it now, is to cause the gradual dropping
of the foreign termination. Yet this too is not
unimportant; it often goes far to making a home
for a word, and hindering it from wearing the appearance
of a foreigner and
stranger<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Analysis of English</i></div>

<p>But to return from this digression&mdash;I said just
now that you would learn very much from observing
and calculating the proportions in which the
words of one descent and those of another occur in
any passage which you analyse. Thus examine
the Lord’s Prayer. It consists of exactly seventy
words. You will find that only the following six
claim the rights of Latin citizenship&mdash;‘trespasses’,
‘trespass’, ‘temptation’, ‘deliver’, ‘power’,
‘glory’. Nor would it be very difficult to substitute
for any one of these a Saxon word. Thus
for ‘trespasses’ might be
<ins class="correction" title="original reads ‘substitued’">substituted</ins> ‘sins’; for
‘deliver’ ‘free’; for ‘power’ ‘might’; for ‘glory’
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>‘brightness’; which would only leave ‘temptation’,
about which there could be the slightest
difficulty, and ‘trials’, though we now ascribe to
the word a somewhat different sense, would in fact
exactly correspond to it. This is but a small percentage,
six words in seventy, or less than ten in the
hundred; and we often light upon a still smaller
proportion. Thus take the first three verses of the
23rd Psalm:&mdash;“The Lord is my Shepherd; therefore
can I lack nothing; He shall feed me in a
green <i>pasture</i>, and lead me forth beside the waters
of <i>comfort</i>; He shall <i>convert</i> my soul, and bring me
forth in the paths of righteousness for his Name’s
sake”. Here are forty-five words, and only the
three in italics are Latin; and for every one of
these too it would be easy to substitute a word of
Saxon origin; little more, that is, than the proportion
of seven in the hundred; while, still
stronger than this, in five verses out of Genesis,
containing one hundred and thirty words, there are
only five not Saxon, less, that is, than four in the
hundred.</p>

<p>Shall we therefore conclude that these are the
proportions in which the Anglo-Saxon and Latin
elements of the language stand to one another?
If they are so, then my former proposal to express
their relations by sixty and thirty was greatly at
fault; and seventy and twenty, or even eighty and
ten, would fall short of adequately representing the
real predominance of the Saxon over the Latin
element of the language. But it is not so; the
Anglo-Saxon words by no means outnumber the
Latin in the degree which the analysis of those
passages would seem to imply. It is not that there<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
are so many more Anglo-Saxon words, but that
the words which there are, being words of more
primary necessity, do therefore so much more
frequently recur. The proportions which the
analysis of the <i>dictionary</i> that is, of the language
<i>at rest</i>, would furnish, are very different from
these which I have just instanced, and which the
analysis of <i>sentences</i>, or of the language <i>in motion</i>,
gives. Thus if we examine the total vocabulary
of the English Bible, not more than sixty per cent.
of the words are native; such are the results
which the Concordance gives; but in the actual
translation the native words are from ninety in
some passages to ninety-six in others per cent<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Anglo-Saxon the Base of English</i></div>

<p>The notice of this fact will lead us to some very
important conclusions as to the <i>character</i> of the
words which the Saxon and the Latin severally
furnish; and principally to this:&mdash;that while the
English language is thus compact in the main of
these two elements, we must not for all this regard
these two as making, one and the other, exactly
the same <i>kind</i> of contributions to it. On the contrary
their contributions are of very different character.
The Anglo-Saxon is not so much, as I have
just called it, one element of the English language,
as the foundation of it, the basis. All
its joints, its whole <i>articulation</i>, its sinews and its
ligaments, the great body of articles, pronouns,
conjunctions, prepositions, numerals, auxiliary
verbs, all smaller words which serve to knit together
and bind the larger into sentences, these,
not to speak of the grammatical structure of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
language, are exclusively Saxon. The Latin may
contribute its tale of bricks, yea, of goodly and
polished hewn stones, to the spiritual building;
but the mortar, with all that holds and binds the
different parts of it together, and constitutes them
into a house, is Saxon throughout. I remember
Selden in his <i>Table Talk</i> using another comparison;
but to the same effect: “If you look upon
the language spoken in the Saxon time, and the
language spoken now, you will find the difference
to be just as if a man had a cloak which he wore
plain in Queen Elizabeth’s days, and since, here
has put in a piece of red, and there a piece of
blue, and here a piece of green, and there a piece of
orange-tawny. We borrow words from the French,
Italian, Latin, as every pedantic man pleases”.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Composite Languages</i></div>

<p>I believe this to be the law which holds good in
respect of all composite languages. However composite
they may be, yet they are only so in regard
of their words. There may be a medley in respect
of these, some coming from one quarter, some
from another; but there is never a mixture of
grammatical forms and inflections. One or other
language entirely predominates here, and everything
has to conform and subordinate itself to the
laws of this ruling and ascendant language. The
Anglo-Saxon is the ruling language in our present
English. Thus while it has thought good to drop
its genders, even so the French substantives which
come among us, must also leave theirs behind
them; as in like manner the French verbs must
renounce their own conjugations, and adapt themselves
to ours<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>.
I believe that a remarkable<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
parallel to this might be found in the language of
Persia, since the conquest of that country by the
Arabs. The ancient Persian religion fell with the
government, but the language remained totally
unaffected by the revolution, in its grammatical
structure and character. Arabic vocables, the
only exotic words in Persian, are found in numbers
varying with the object and quality, style and
taste of the writers, but pages of pure idiomatic
Persian may be written without employing a
single word from the Arabic.</p>

<p>At the same time the secondary or superinduced
language, even while it is quite unable to force any
of its forms on the language which receives its
words, may yet compel that to renounce a portion
of its own forms, by the impossibility which is
practically found to exist of making them fit the
new comers; and thus it may exert although not
a positive, yet a negative, influence on the grammar
of the other tongue. It has been so, as is generally
admitted, in the instance of our own. “When the
English language was inundated by a vast influx
of French words, few, if any, French forms were
received into its grammar; but the Saxon forms
soon dropped away, because they did not suit the
new roots; and the genius of the language, from
having to deal with the newly imported words in
a rude state, was induced to neglect the inflections
of the native ones. This for instance led to the
introduction of the <i>s</i> as the universal termination
of all plural nouns, which agreed with the usage<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
of the French language, and was not alien from
that of the Saxon, but was merely an extension
of the termination of the ancient masculine to
other classes of nouns”<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>The Anglo-Saxon Element</i></div>

<p>If you wish to convince yourselves by actual
experience, of the fact which I just now asserted,
namely, that the radical constitution of the language
is Saxon, I would say, Try to compose a
sentence, let it be only of ten or a dozen words,
and the subject entirely of your choice, employing
therein only words which are of a Latin derivation.
I venture to say you will find it impossible, or
next to impossible to do it; whichever way you
turn, some obstacle will meet you in the face.
And while it is thus with the Latin, whole pages
might be written, I do not say in philosophy or
theology or upon any abstruser subject, but on
familiar matters of common everyday life, in
which every word should be of Saxon extraction,
not one of Latin; and these, pages in which,
with the exercise of a little patience and ingenuity,
all appearance of awkwardness and constraint
should be avoided, so that it should never occur
to the reader, unless otherwise informed, that the
writer had submitted himself to this restraint and
limitation in the words which he employed, and
was only drawing them from one section of the
English language. Sir Thomas Browne has given
several long paragraphs so constructed. Take
for instance the following, which is only a little
fragment of one of them: “The first and foremost
step to all good works is the dread and fear of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
Lord of heaven and earth, which through the Holy
Ghost enlighteneth the blindness of our sinful
hearts to tread the ways of wisdom, and lead our
feet into the land of blessing”<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>. This is not
stiffer than the ordinary English of his time. I
would suggest to you at your leisure to make these
two experiments; you will find it, I think, exactly
as I have here affirmed.</p>

<p>While thus I bring before you the fact that it
would be quite possible to write English, forgoing
altogether the use of the Latin portion of the
language, I would not have you therefore to conclude
that this portion of the language is of little
value, or that we could draw from the resources
of our Teutonic tongue efficient substitutes for all
the words which it has contributed to our glossary.
I am persuaded that we could not; and, if we
could, that it would not be desirable. I mention
this, because there is sometimes a regret expressed
that we have not kept our language more free
from the admixture of Latin, a suggestion made
that we should even now endeavour to keep under
the Latin element of it, and as little as possible
avail ourselves of it. I remember Lord Brougham
urging upon the students at Glasgow as a help to
writing good English, that they should do their
best to rid their diction of long-tailed words in
‘osity’ and ‘ation’<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>. He plainly intended to indicate
by this phrase all learned Latin words, or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
words derived from the Latin. This exhortation
is by no means superfluous; for doubtless there
were writers of a former age, Samuel Johnson in
the last century, Henry More and Sir Thomas
Browne in the century preceding, who gave undue
preponderance to the learned, or Latin, portion in
our language; and very much of its charm, of its
homely strength and beauty, of its most popular
and truest idioms, would have perished from it,
had they succeeded in persuading others to write
as they had written.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Anglo-Saxon Aboriginal</i></div>

<p>But for all this we could <i>almost</i> as ill spare this
side of the language as the other. It represents
and supplies needs not less real than the other
does. Philosophy and science and the arts of a
high civilization find their utterance in the Latin
words of our language, or, if not in the Latin, in
the Greek, which for present purposes may be
grouped with them. How they should have
found utterance in the speech of rude tribes,
which, never having cultivated the things, must
needs have been without the words which should
express those things. Granting too that, <i>cœteris
paribus</i>, when a Latin and a Saxon word offer
themselves to our choice, we shall generally do
best to employ the Saxon, to speak of ‘happiness’
rather than ‘felicity’, ‘almighty’ rather than
‘omnipotent’, a ‘forerunner’ rather than a ‘precursor’,
still these latter must be regarded as much
denizens in the language as the former, no alien
interlopers, but possessing the rights of citizenship
as fully as the most Saxon word of them all.
One part of the language is not to be favoured at
the expense of the other; the Saxon at the cost<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
of the Latin, as little as the Latin at the cost of
the Saxon. “Both are indispensable; and speaking
generally without stopping to distinguish as to
subject, both are <i>equally</i> indispensable. Pathos,
in situations which are homely, or at all connected
with domestic affections, naturally moves by Saxon
words. Lyrical emotion of every kind, which (to
merit the name of <i>lyrical</i>) must be in the state
of flux and reflux, or, generally, of agitation, also
requires the Saxon element of our language. And
why? Because the Saxon is the aboriginal element;
the basis and not the superstructure: consequently
it comprehends all the ideas which are
natural to the heart of man and to the elementary
situations of life. And although the Latin often
furnishes us with duplicates of these ideas, yet the
Saxon, or monosyllabic part, has the advantage of
precedency in our use and knowledge; for it is the
language of the nursery whether for rich or poor,
in which great philological academy no toleration
is given to words in ‘osity’ or ‘ation’. There is
therefore a great advantage, as regards the consecration
to our feelings, settled by usage and custom
upon the Saxon strands in the mixed yarn
of our native tongue. And universally, this may
be remarked&mdash;that wherever the passion of a
poem is of that sort which <i>uses</i>, <i>presumes</i>, or
<i>postulates</i> the ideas, without seeking to extend
them, Saxon will be the ‘cocoon’ (to speak by
the language applied to silk-worms), which the
poem spins for itself. But on the other hand,
where the motion of the feeling is <i>by</i> and <i>through</i>
the ideas, where (as in religious or meditative
poetry&mdash;Young’s, for instance, or Cowper’s), the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
pathos creeps and kindles underneath the very
tissues of the thinking, there the Latin will predominate;
and so much so that, whilst the flesh, the
blood, and the muscle, will be often almost exclusively
Latin, the articulations only, or hinges
of connection, will be the Anglo-Saxon”.</p>

<p>These words which I have just quoted are De
Quincey’s&mdash;whom I must needs esteem the greatest
living master of our English tongue. And on the
same matter Sir Francis Palgrave has expressed
himself thus: “Upon the languages of Teutonic
origin the Latin has exercised great influence, but
most energetically on our own. The very early
admixture of the <i>Langue d’Oil</i>, the never interrupted
employment of the French as the language
of education, and the nomenclature created by the
scientific and literary cultivation of advancing and
civilized society, have Romanized our speech; the
warp may be Anglo-Saxon, but the woof is Roman
as well as the embroidery, and these foreign materials
have so entered into the texture, that were
they plucked out, the web would be torn to rags,
unravelled and destroyed”<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>The English Bible</i></div>

<p>I do not know where we could find a happier
example of the preservation of the golden mean
in this matter than in our
<ins class="correction" title="original reads ‘authorized’">Authorized</ins> Version of the
Bible. One of the chief among the minor and
secondary blessings which that Version has conferred
on the nation or nations drawing spiritual
life from it,&mdash;a blessing not small in itself, but
only small by comparison with the infinitely
higher blessings whereof it is the vehicle to them,&mdash;is
the happy wisdom, the instinctive tact, with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
which its authors have steered between any futile
mischievous attempt to ignore the full rights of
the Latin part of the language on the one side,
and on the other any burdening of their Version
with such a multitude of learned Latin terms as
should cause it to forfeit its homely character,
and shut up large portions of it from the understanding
of plain and unlearned men. There is a
remarkable confession to this effect, to the wisdom,
in fact, which guided them from above, to
the providence that overruled their work, an
honourable acknowledgement of the immense
superiority in this respect of our English Version
over the Romish, made by one now, unhappily,
familiar with the latter, as once he was with our
own. Among those who have recently abandoned
the communion of the English Church one has
exprest himself in deeply touching tones of lamentation
over all, which in renouncing our translation,
he feels himself to have forgone and lost. These
are his words: “Who will not say that the uncommon
beauty and marvellous English of the
Protestant Bible is not one of the great strongholds
of heresy in this country? It lives on the
ear, like a music that can never be forgotten, like
the sound of church bells, which the convert
hardly knows how he can forgo. Its felicities
often seem to be almost things rather than mere
words. It is part of the national mind, and the
anchor of national seriousness.... The memory
of the dead passes into it. The potent
traditions of childhood are stereotyped in its
verses. The power of all the griefs and trials of
a man is hidden beneath its words. It is the re<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>presentative
of his best moments, and all that
there has been about him of soft and gentle and
pure and penitent and good speaks to him for
ever out of his English Bible.... It is his
sacred thing, which doubt has never dimmed, and
controversy never soiled. In the length and
breadth of the land there is not a Protestant with
one spark of religiousness about him, whose spiritual
biography is not in his Saxon Bible”<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>The Rhemish Bible</i></div>

<p>Such are his touching words; and certainly one
has only to compare this version of ours with the
Rhemish, and the transcendent excellence of our
own reveals itself at once. I am not extolling
now its superior scholarship; its greater freedom
from by-ends; as little would I urge the fact that
one translation is from the original Greek, the
other from the Latin Vulgate, and thus the translation
of a translation, often reproducing the mistakes
of that translation; but, putting aside all
considerations such as these, I speak only here of
the superiority of the diction in which the meaning,
be it correct or incorrect, is conveyed to English
readers. Thus I open the Rhemish version at
<ins class="correction" title="original reads ‘Galations’">Galatians</ins>
v. 19, where the long list of the “works
of the flesh”, and of the “fruit of the Spirit”,
is given. But what could a mere English reader
make of words such as these&mdash;‘impudicity’,
‘ebrieties’, ‘comessations’, ‘longanimity’, all
which occur in that passage? while our Version for
‘ebrieties’ has ‘drunkenness’, for ‘comessations’
has ‘revellings’, and so also for ‘longanimity’
‘longsuffering’. Or set over against one<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
another such phrases as these,&mdash;in the Rhemish,
“the exemplars of the celestials” (Heb. ix. 23),
but in ours, “the patterns of things in the heavens”.
Or suppose if, instead of the words <i>we</i> read at
Heb. xiii. 16, namely “To do good and to communicate
forget not; for with such sacrifices
God is well pleased”, we read as follows, which
are the words of the Rhemish, “Beneficence and
communication do not forget; for with such hosts
God is promerited”!&mdash;Who does not feel that if
our Version had been composed in such Latin-English
as this, had abounded in words like
‘odible’, ‘suasible’, ‘exinanite’, ‘contristate’,
‘postulations’, ‘coinquinations’, ‘agnition’, ‘zealatour’,
all, with many more of the same mint,
in the Rhemish Version, our loss would have been
great and enduring, one which would have searched
into the whole religious life of our people, and been
felt in the very depths of the national mind<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>?</p>

<p>There was indeed something still deeper than
love of sound and genuine English at work in our
Translators, whether they were conscious of it or
not, which hindered them from presenting the
Scriptures to their fellow-countrymen dressed out
in such a semi-Latin garb as this. The Reformation,
which they were in this translation so
mightily strengthening and confirming, was just a
throwing off, on the part of the Teutonic nations,
of that everlasting pupilage in which Rome would
have held them; an assertion at length that they
were come to full age, and that not through her,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
but directly through Christ, they would address
themselves unto God. The use of the Latin
language as the language of worship, as the language
in which the Scriptures might alone be
read, had been the great badge of servitude, even
as the Latin habits of thought and feeling which
it promoted had been the great helps to the continuance
of this servitude, through long ages. It
lay deep then in the very nature of their cause
that the Reformers should develop the Saxon, or
essentially national, element in the language;
while it was just as natural that the Roman Catholic
translators, if they must translate the Scriptures
into English at all, should yet translate
them into such English as should bear the nearest
possible resemblance to the Latin Vulgate, which
Rome with a very deep wisdom of this world
would gladly have seen as the only one in the
hands of the faithful.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Future of the English Language</i></div>

<p>Let me again, however, recur to the fact that
what our Reformers did in this matter, they did
without exaggeration; even as they had shown the
same wise moderation in still higher matters.
They gave to the Latin side of the language its
rights, though they would not suffer it to encroach
upon and usurp those of the Teutonic part of the
language. It would be difficult not to believe,
even if many outward signs said not the same,
that great things are in store for the one language
of Europe which thus serves as connecting link
between the North and the South, between the
languages spoken by the Teutonic nations of
the North and by the Romance nations of the
South; which holds on to and partakes of both;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
which is as a middle term between them<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>.
<ins class="correction" title="so in original">There
are who</ins> venture to hope that the English Church,
being in like manner double-fronted, looking on
the one side toward Rome, being herself truly
Catholic, looking on the other towards the Protestant
communions, being herself also protesting
and reforming, may yet in the providence of God
have an important part to play for the reconciling
of a divided Christendom. And if this ever
should be so, if, notwithstanding our sins and
unworthiness, so blessed a task should be in store
for her, it will not be a small help and assistance
thereunto, that the language in which her mediation
will be effected is one wherein both parties
may claim their own, in which neither will feel
that it is receiving the adjudication of a stranger,
of one who must be an alien from its deeper
thoughts and habits, because an alien from its
words, but a language in which both must recognize
very much of that which is deepest and most
precious of their own.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Jacob Grimm on English</i></div>

<p>Nor is this prerogative which I have just claimed
for our English the mere dream and fancy of
patriotic vanity. The scholar who in our days
is most profoundly acquainted with the great group
of the Gothic languages in Europe, and a devoted
lover, if ever there was such, of his native German,
I mean Jacob Grimm, has expressed himself very
nearly to the same effect, and given the palm over
all to our English in words which you will not
grudge to hear quoted, and with which I shall bring<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
this lecture to a close. After ascribing to our
language “a veritable power of expression, such
as perhaps never stood at the command of any
other language of men”, he goes on to say, “Its
highly spiritual genius, and wonderfully happy
development and condition, have been the result
of a surprisingly intimate union of the two noblest
languages in modern Europe, the Teutonic and the
Romance&mdash;It is well known in what relation these
two stand to one another in the English tongue;
the former supplying in far larger proportion the
material groundwork, the latter the spiritual conceptions.
In truth the English language, which
by no mere accident has produced and upborne
the greatest and most predominant poet of modern
times, as distinguished from the ancient classical
poetry (I can, of course, only mean Shakespeare),

of structure no other of the languages at this day

Somewhat different from this, yet itself also curious,
is the passing of an Anglo-Saxon word in two different
forms into English, and continuing in both; thus ‘desk’
and ‘dish’, both the Anglo-Saxon ‘disc’ [a loan-word
from Latin <i>discus</i>, Greek <i>diskos</i>] the German ‘tisch’;
‘beech’ and ‘book’, both the Anglo-Saxon ‘boc’, our
first books being <i>beechen</i> tablets (see Grimm, <i>Wörterbuch</i>,
s. vv. ‘Buch’, ‘Buche’); ‘girdle’ and ‘kirtle’; both
of them corresponding to the German ‘gürtel’; already
in Anglo-Saxon a double spelling, ‘gyrdel’, ‘cyrtel’,
had prepared for the double words; so too ‘haunch’
and ‘hinge’; ‘lady’ and ‘lofty’ [these last three instances
are not doublets at all, being quite unrelated; see Skeat,
s. vv.]; ‘shirt’, and ‘skirt’; ‘black’ and ‘bleak’; ‘pond’
and ‘pound’; ‘deck’ and ‘thatch’; ‘deal’ and ‘dole’;
‘weald’ and ‘wood’†; ‘dew’ and ‘thaw’†; ‘wayward’
and ‘awkward’†; ‘dune’ and ‘down’; ‘hood’ and
‘hat’†; ‘ghost’ and ‘gust’†; ‘evil’ and ‘ill’†;
‘mouth’ and ‘moth’†; ‘hedge’ and ‘hay’.</p>

We have in the same way double adoptions from the
Greek, one direct, at least as regards the forms; one
modified by its passage through some other language;
thus, ‘adamant’ and ‘diamond’; ‘monastery’ and
‘minster’; ‘scandal’ and ‘slander’; ‘theriac’ and
‘treacle’; ‘asphodel’ and ‘daffodil’; ‘presbyter’ and

<a href="#FNanchor_26_26"><span class="label">[26]</span></a>
The French itself has also a double adoption, or as
perhaps we should more accurately call it there, a double
formation, from the Latin, and such as quite bears out
what has been said above: one going far back in the
history of the language, the other belonging to a later
and more literary period; on which subject there are
some admirable remarks by Génin, <i>Récréations Philologiques</i>,
vol. i. pp. 162-66; and see Fuchs, <i>Die Roman.
Sprachen</i>, p. 125. Thus from ‘separare’ is derived
‘sevrer’, to separate the child from its mother’s breast,
to wean, but also ‘séparer’, without this special sense;
from ‘pastor’, ‘pâtre’, a shepherd in the literal, and
‘pasteur’ the same in a tropical, sense; from ‘catena’,
‘chaîne’ and ‘cadène’; from ‘fragilis’, ‘frêle’ and
‘fragile’; from ‘pensare’, ‘peser’ and ‘penser’; from
‘gehenna’, ‘gêne’ and ‘géhenne’; from ‘captivus’,
‘chétif’ and ‘captif’; from ‘nativus’, ‘naïf’ and
‘natif’; from ‘designare’, ‘dessiner’ and ‘designer’;
from ‘decimare’, ‘dîmer’ and ‘décimer’; from ‘consumere’,
‘consommer’ and ‘consumer’; from ‘simulare’,
‘sembler’ and ‘simuler’; from the low Latin, ‘disjejunare’,
‘dîner’ and ‘déjeûner’; from ‘acceptare’,
‘acheter’ and ‘accepter’; from ‘homo’, ‘on’ and
‘homme’; from ‘paganus’, ‘payen’ and ‘paysan’ [the
latter from ‘pagensis’]; from ‘obedientia’, ‘obéissance’
and ‘obédience’; from ‘strictus’, ‘étroit’ and ‘strict’;
from ‘sacramentum’, ‘serment’ and ‘sacrement’;
from ‘ministerium’, ‘métier’ and ‘ministère’; from
‘parabola’, ‘parole’ and ‘parabole’; from ‘peregrinus’,
‘pélerin’ and ‘pérégrin’; from ‘factio’, ‘façon’ and
‘faction’, and it has now adopted ‘factio’ in a third
shape, that is, in our English ‘fashion’; from ‘pietas’,
‘pitié’ and ‘piété’; from ‘capitulum’, ‘chapitre’ and
‘capitule’, a botanical term. So, too, in Italian, ‘manco’,
maimed, and ‘monco’, maimed <i>of a hand</i>; ‘rifutáre’,
to refute, and ‘rifiutáre’, to refuse; ‘dama’ and
‘donna’, both forms of ‘domina’.</p></div>

<h3>GAINS OF THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE</h3>


<p>It is not for nothing that we speak of some languages
as <i>living</i>, of others as <i>dead</i>. All spoken
languages may be ranged in the first class; for
as men will never consent to use a language without
more or less modifying it in their use, will never
so far forgo their own activity as to leave it
exactly where they found it, it will therefore,
so long as it is thus the utterance of human thought
and feeling, inevitably show itself alive by many
infallible proofs, by motion, growth, acquisition,
loss, progress, and decay. A living language
therefore is one which abundantly deserves this
name; for it is one in which, spoken as it is by
living men, a <i>vital</i> formative energy is still at
work. It is one which is in course of actual evolution,
which, if the life that animates it be a
healthy one, is appropriating and assimilating
to itself what it anywhere finds congenial to its
own life, multiplying its resources, increasing its
wealth; while at the same time it is casting off
useless and cumbersome forms, dismissing from its
vocabulary words of which it finds no use, rejecting
from itself by a re-active energy the foreign
and heterogeneous, which may for a while have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
been forced upon it. I would not assert that in
the process of all this it does not make mistakes;
in the desire to simplify it may let go distinctions
which were not useless, and which it would have
been better to retain; the acquisitions which it
makes are very far from being all gains; it sometimes
rejects words as worthless, or suffers words
to die out, which were most worthy to have lived.
So far as it does this its life is not perfectly healthy;
there are here signs, however remote, of disorganization,
decay, and ultimate death; but still it
lives, and even these misgrowths and malformations,
the rejection of this good, the taking up
into itself of that ill, all these errors are themselves
the utterances and evidences of life. A
dead language is the contrary of all this. It is
dead, because books, and not now any generation
of living men, are the guardians of it, and what
they guard, they guard without change. Its
course has been completely run, and it is now
equally incapable of gaining and of losing. We
may come to know it better; but in itself it is
not, and never can be, other than it was when
it ceased from the lips of men.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>English a Living Language</i></div>

<p>Our own is, of course, a living language still.
It is therefore gaining and losing. It is a tree in
which the vital sap is circulating yet, ascending
from the roots into the branches; and as this
works, new leaves are continually being put forth
by it, old are dying and dropping away. I propose
for the subject of my present lecture to consider
some of the evidences of this life at work in
it still. As I took for the subject of my first lecture
the actual proportions in which the several<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
elements of our composite English are now found
in it, and the service which they were severally
called on to perform, so I shall consider in this the
<i>sources</i> from which the English language has enriched
its vocabulary, the <i>periods</i> at which it has
made the chief additions to this, the <i>character</i> of
the additions which at different periods it has
made, and the <i>motives</i> which induced it to seek them.</p>

<p>I had occasion to mention in that lecture and
indeed I dwelt with some emphasis on the fact,
that the core, the radical constitution of our language,
is Anglo-Saxon; so that, composite or
mingled as it must be freely allowed to be, it is only
such in respect to words, not in respect of construction,
inflexions, or generally its grammatical
forms. These are all of one piece; and whatever
of new has come in has been compelled to conform
itself to these. The framework is English; only
a part of the filling in is otherwise; and of this
filling in, of these its comparatively more recent
accessions, I now propose to speak.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>The Norman Conquest</i></div>

<p>The first great augmentation by foreign words
of our Saxon vocabulary, setting aside those which
the Danes brought us, was a consequence, although
not an immediate one, of the battle of Hastings,
and of the Norman domination which Duke
William’s victory established in our land. And
here let me say in respect of that victory, in contradiction
to the sentimental regrets of Thierry and
others, and with the fullest acknowledgement of
the immediate miseries which it entailed on the
Saxon race, that it was really the making of England;
a judgment, it is true, but a judgment and
mercy in one. God never showed more plainly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
that He had great things in store for the people
which should occupy this English soil, than when
He brought hither that aspiring Norman race.
At the same time the actual interpenetration of
our Anglo-Saxon with any large amount of French
words did not find place till very considerably
later than this event, however it was a consequence
of it. Some French words we find very soon after;
but in the main the two streams of language continued
for a long while separate and apart, even
as the two nations remained aloof, a conquering
and a conquered, and neither forgetting the fact.</p>

<p>Time however softened the mutual antipathies.
The Norman, after a while shut out from France,
began more and more to feel that England was
his home and sphere. The Saxon, recovering
little by little from the extreme depression which
had ensued on his defeat, became every day a
more important element of the new English nation
which was gradually forming from the coalition
of the two races. His language partook of his
elevation. It was no longer the badge of inferiority.
French was no longer the only language in which
a gentleman could speak, or a poet sing. At
the same time the Saxon, now passing into the
English language, required a vast addition to its
vocabulary, if it were to serve all the needs of
those who were willing to employ it now. How
much was there of high culture, how many of the
arts of life, of its refined pleasures, which had been
strange to Saxon men, and had therefore found no
utterance in Saxon words. All this it was sought
to supply from the French.</p>

<p>We shall not err, I think, if we assume the great<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
period of the incoming of French words into the
English language to have been when the Norman
nobility were exchanging their own language for
the English; and I should be disposed with Tyrwhitt
to believe that there is much exaggeration in
attributing the large influx of these into English
to one man’s influence, namely to Chaucer’s<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a>.
Doubtless he did much; he fell in with and furthered
a tendency which already prevailed.
But to suppose that the majority of French vocables
which he employed in his poems had never
been employed before, had been hitherto unfamiliar
to English ears, is to suppose that his poems
must have presented to his contemporaries an
absurd patchwork of two languages, and leaves
it impossible to explain how he should at once
have become the popular poet of our nation.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Influence of Chaucer</i></div>

<p>That Chaucer largely developed the language in
this direction is indeed plain. We have only to
compare his English with that of another great
master of the tongue, his contemporary Wiclif, to
perceive how much more his diction is saturated
with French words than is that of the Reformer.
We may note too that many which he and others
employed, and as it were proposed for admission,
were not finally allowed and received; so that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
no doubt they went beyond the needs of the language,
and were here in excess<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a>. At the same
time this can be regarded as no condemnation of
their attempt. It was only by actual experience
that it could be proved whether the language
wanted those words or not, whether it could
absorb them into itself, and assimilate them with
all that it already was and had; or did not require,
and would therefore in due time reject and put
them away. And what happened then will happen
in every attempt to transplant on a large scale
the words of one language into another. Some
will take root; others will not, but after a longer
or briefer period will wither and die. Thus I
observe in Chaucer such French words as these,
‘misericorde’, ‘malure’ (malheur), ‘penible’,
‘ayel’ (aieul), ‘tas’, ‘gipon’, ‘pierrie’ (precious
stones); none of which, and Wiclif’s ‘creansur’
(2 Kings iv. 1) as little, have permanently won a
place in our tongue. For a long time ‘mel’,
used often by Sylvester, struggled hard for a place
in the language side by side with honey; ‘roy’
side by side with king; this last quite obtained
one in Scotch. It is curious to mark some of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
these French adoptions keeping their ground to
a comparatively late day, and yet finally extruded:
seeming to have taken firm root, they have yet
withered away in the end. Thus it has been,
for example, with ‘egal’ (Puttenham); with
‘ouvert’, ‘mot’, ‘ecurie’, ‘baston’, ‘gite’
(Holland); with ‘rivage’, ‘jouissance’, ‘noblesse’,
‘tort’ (=&nbsp;wrong), ‘accoil’ (accuellir),
‘sell’ (=&nbsp;saddle), all occurring in Spenser; with
‘to serr’ (serrer), ‘vive’, ‘reglement’, used all by
Bacon; and so with ‘esperance’, ‘orgillous’
(orgueilleux), ‘rondeur’, ‘scrimer’ (=&nbsp;fencer),
all in Shakespeare; with ‘amort’ (this also in
Shakespeare)<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a>, and ‘avie’ (Holland). ‘Maugre’,
‘congie’, ‘devoir’, ‘dimes’, ‘sans’, and ‘bruit’,
used often in our Bible, were English once<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a>; when
we employ them now, it is with the sense that we
are using foreign words. The same is true of
‘dulce’, ‘aigredoulce’ (=&nbsp;soursweet), of ‘mur’
for wall, of ‘baine’ for bath, of the verb ‘to cass’
(all in Holland), of ‘volupty’ (Sir Thomas Elyot),
‘volunty’ (Evelyn), ‘medisance’ (Montagu),
‘petit’ (South), ‘aveugle’, ‘colline’ (both in
<i>State Papers</i>), and ‘eloign’ (Hacket)<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a>.</p>

<p>We have seen when the great influx of French<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
words took place&mdash;that is, from the time of the
Conquest, although scantily and feebly at the first,
to that of Chaucer. But with him our literature
and language had made a burst, which they were
not able to maintain. He has by Warton been
well compared to some warm bright day in the
very early spring, which seems to say that the
winter is over and gone; but its promise is deceitful;
the full bursting and blossoming of the springtime
are yet far off. That struggle with France
which began so gloriously, but ended so disastrously,
even with the loss of our whole ill-won
dominion there, the savagery of our wars of the
Roses, wars which were a legacy bequeathed to us
by that unrighteous conquest, leave a huge gap in
our literary history, nearly a century during which
very little was done for the cultivation of our
native tongue, during which it could have made
few important accessions to its wealth.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Latin Importation</i></div>

<p>The period however is notable as being that
during which for the first time we received a large
accession of Latin words. There was indeed
already a small settlement of these, for the most
part ecclesiastical, which had long since found their
home in the bosom of the Anglo-Saxon itself, and
had been entirely incorporated into it. The fact
that we had received our Christianity from Rome,
and that Latin was the constant language of the
Church, sufficiently explains the incoming of these.
Such were ‘monk’, ‘bishop’ (I put them in their
present shapes, and do not concern myself whether
they were originally Greek or no; they reached <i>us</i>
as Latin); ‘provost’, ‘minster’, ‘cloister’,
‘candle’, ‘psalter’, ‘mass’, and the names of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
certain foreign animals, as ‘camel’, or plants or
other productions, as ‘pepper’, ‘fig’; which are
all, with slightly different orthography, Anglo-Saxon
words. These, however, were entirely
exceptional, and stood to the main body of the
language not as the Romance element of it does
now to the Gothic, one power over against another,
but as the Spanish or Italian or Arabic words in
it now stand to the whole present body of the
language&mdash;and could not be affirmed to affect it
more.</p>

<p>So soon however as French words were imported
largely, as I have just observed, into the language,
and were found to coalesce kindly with the native
growths, this very speedily suggested, as indeed it
alone rendered possible, the going straight to the
Latin, and drawing directly from it; and thus in
the hundred years which followed Chaucer a large
amount of Latin found its way, if not into our
speech, yet at all events into our books&mdash;words
which were not brought <i>through</i> the French, for
they are not, and have not at any time been,
French, but yet words which would never have
been introduced into English, if their way had not
been prepared, if the French already domesticated
among us had not bridged over, as it were, the
gulf, that would have otherwise been too wide
between them and the Saxon vocables of our
tongue.</p>

<p>In this period, a period of great depression of
the national spirit, we may trace the attempt at a
pedantic latinization of English quite as clearly at
work as at later periods, subsequent to the revival
of learning. It was now that a crop of such words<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
as ‘facundious’, ‘tenebrous’, ‘solacious’, ‘pulcritude’,
‘consuetude’ (all these occur in Hawes),
with many more, long since rejected by the language,
sprung up; while other words, good in
themselves, and which have been since allowed,
were yet employed in numbers quite out of proportion
with the Saxon vocables with which they
were mingled, and which they altogether overtopped
and shadowed. Chaucer’s hearty English
feeling, his thorough sympathy with the people,
the fact that, scholar as he was, he was yet the
poet not of books but of life, and drew his best
inspiration from life, all this had kept him, in the
main, clear of this fault. But in others it is very
manifest. Thus I must esteem the diction of
Lydgate, Hawes, and the other versifiers who
filled up the period between Chaucer and Surrey,
immensely inferior to Chaucer’s; being all stuck
over with long and often ill-selected Latin words.
The worst offenders in this line, as Campbell himself
admits, were the Scotch poets of the fifteenth
century. “The prevailing fault”, he says, “of
English diction, in the fifteenth century, is redundant
ornament, and an affectation of anglicising
Latin words. In this pedantry and use of “aureate
terms” the Scottish versifiers went even
beyond their brethren of the south.... When
they meant to be eloquent, they tore up words
from the Latin, which never took root in the language,
like children making a mock garden with
flowers and branches stuck in the ground, which
speedily wither”<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a>.</p>

<p>To few indeed is the wisdom and discretion<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
given, certainly it was given to none of those, to
bear themselves in this hazardous enterprise
according to the rules laid down by Dryden; who
in the following admirable passage declares the
motives that induced him to seek for foreign
words, and the considerations that guided him
in their selection: “If sounding words are not
of our growth and manufacture, who shall hinder
me to import them from a foreign country?
I carry not out the treasure of the nation which
is never to return, but what I bring from Italy
I spend in England. Here it remains and here
it circulates, for, if the coin be good, it will pass
from one hand to another. I trade both with
the living and the dead, for the enrichment of
our native language. We have enough in England
to supply our necessity, but if we will have things
of magnificence and splendour, we must get them
by commerce. Poetry requires adornment, and
that is not to be had from our old Teuton monosyllables;
therefore if I find any elegant word in a
classic author, I propose it to be naturalized by
using it myself; and if the public approves of it,
the bill passes. But every man cannot distinguish
betwixt pedantry and poetry: every man therefore
is not fit to innovate. Upon the whole matter
a poet must first be certain that the word he
would introduce is beautiful in the Latin; and
is to consider in the next place whether it will
agree with the English idiom: after this, he ought
to take the opinion of judicious friends, such as
are learned in both languages; and lastly, since
no man is infallible, let him use this licence very
sparingly; for if too many foreign words are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
poured in upon us, it looks as if they were designed
not to assist the natives, but to conquer them”<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Influence of the Reformation</i></div>

<p>But this tendency to latinize our speech was
likely to receive, and actually did receive, a new
impulse from the revival of learning, and the
familiar re-acquaintance with the great masterpieces
of <ins class="correction" title="original reads ‘antient’">ancient</ins>
literature which went along
with this revival. Happily another movement
accompanied, or at least followed hard on this;
a movement in England essentially national;
and which stirred our people at far deeper depths
of their moral and spiritual life than any mere
revival of learning could have ever done; I refer,
of course, to the Reformation. It was only
among the Germanic nations of Europe, as has
often been remarked, that the Reformation struck
lasting roots; it found its strength therefore in
the Teutonic element of the national character,
which also it in its turn further strengthened,
purified, and called out. And thus, though Latin
came in upon us now faster than ever, and in a
certain measure also Greek, yet this was not
without its redress and counterpoise, in the
cotemporaneous unfolding of the more fundamentally
popular side of the language. Popular
preaching and discussion, the necessity of dealing
with truths the most transcendent in a way to
be understood not by scholars only, but by
‘idiots’ as well, all this served to evoke the native
resources of our tongue; and thus the relative
proportion between the one part of the language
and the other was not dangerously disturbed,
the balance was not destroyed; as it might
well<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
have been, if only the
Humanists<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> had been at
work, and not the Reformers as well.</p>

<p>The revival of learning, which made itself first
felt in Italy, extended to England, and was operative
here, during the reigns of Henry the Eighth
and his immediate successors. Having thus
slightly anticipated in time, it afterwards ran
exactly parallel with, the period during which
our Reformation was working itself out. The
epoch was in all respects one of immense mental
and moral activity, and such never leave the
language of a nation where they found it. Much
is changed in it; much probably added; for the
old garment of speech, which once served all
needs, has grown too narrow, and serves them
now no more. “Change in language is not, as
in many natural products, continuous; it is not
equable, but eminently by fits and starts”; and
when the foundations of the national mind are
heaving under the power of some new truth,
greater and more important changes will find
place in fifty years than in two centuries of calmer
or more stagnant existence. Thus the activities
and energies which the Reformation awakened
among us here&mdash;and I need not tell you that these
reached far beyond the domain of our directly
religious life&mdash;caused mighty alterations in the
English tongue<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a>.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Rise of New Words</i></div>

<p>For example, the Reformation had its scholarly,
we might say, its scholastic, as well as its popular,
aspect. Add this fact to the fact of the revived
interest in classical learning, and you will not
wonder that a stream of Latin, now larger than
ever, began to flow into our language. Thus
Puttenham, writing in Queen Elizabeth’s
reign<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a>,
gives a long list of words which, as he declares,
had been quite recently introduced into the
language. Some of them are Greek, a few French
and Italian, but very far the most are Latin.
I will not give you his whole catalogue, but some
specimens from it; it is difficult to understand
concerning some of these, how the language
should have managed to do without them so
long; ‘method’, ‘methodical’, ‘function’, ‘nu<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>merous’,
‘penetrate’, ‘penetrable’, ‘indignity’,
‘savage’, ‘scientific’, ‘delineation’, ‘dimension’&mdash;all
which he notes to have recently come up;
so too ‘idiom’, ‘significative’, ‘compendious’,
‘prolix’, ‘figurative’, ‘impression’, ‘inveigle’,
‘metrical’. All these he adduces with praise;
others upon which he bestows equal commendation,
have not held their ground, as ‘placation’,
‘numerosity’, ‘harmonical’. Of those neologies
which he disallowed, he only anticipated in some
cases, as in ‘facundity’, ‘implete’, ‘attemptat’
(‘attentat’), the decision of a later day; other
words which he condemned no less, as ‘audacious’,
‘compatible’, ‘egregious’, have maintained their
ground. These too have done the same; ‘despicable’,
‘destruction’, ‘homicide’, ‘obsequious’,
‘ponderous’, ‘portentous’, ‘prodigious’, all of
them by another writer a little earlier condemned
as “inkhorn terms, smelling too much of the
Latin”.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>French Neologies</i></div>

<p>It is curious to observe the “words of art”,
as he calls them, which Philemon Holland, a
voluminous translator at the end of the sixteenth
and beginning of the seventeenth century, counts
it needful to explain in a sort of glossary which
he appends to his translation of Pliny’s <i>Natural
History</i><a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a>.
One can hardly at the present day<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
understand how any person who would care to
consult the book at all would find any difficulty
with words like the following, ‘acrimony’,
‘austere’, ‘bulb’, ‘consolidate’, ‘debility’,
‘dose’, ‘ingredient’, ‘opiate’, ‘propitious’,
‘symptom’, all which, however, as novelties he
carefully explains. Some of the words in his
glossary, it is true, are harder and more technical
than these; but a vast proportion of them present
no greater difficulty than those which I have
adduced<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a>.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>The period during which this naturalization of
Latin words in the English Language was going
actively forward, may be said to have continued
till about the Restoration of Charles the Second.
It first received a check from the coming up of
French tastes, fashions, and habits of thought
consequent on that event. The writers already
formed before that period, such as Cudworth
and Barrow, still continued to write their stately
sentences, Latin in structure, and Latin in diction,
but not so those of a younger generation. We
may say of this influx of Latin that it left
the language vastly more copious, with greatly
enlarged capabilities, but perhaps somewhat burdened,
and not always able to move gracefully
under the weight of its new acquisitions; for
as Dryden has somewhere truly said, it is easy
enough to acquire foreign words, but to know
what to do with them after you have acquired,
is the difficulty.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Pedantic Words</i></div>

<p>It might have received indeed most serious
injury, if <i>all</i> the words which the great writers
of this second Latin period of our language employed,
and so proposed as candidates for admission
into it, had received the stamp of popular<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
allowance. But happily it was not so; it was
here, as it had been before with the French importations,
and with the earlier Latin of Lydgate
and Occleve. The re-active powers of the
language, enabling it to throw off that which
was foreign to it, did not fail to display themselves
now, as they had done on former occasions.
The number of unsuccessful candidates
for admission into, and permanent naturalization
in, the language during this period, is
enormous; and one may say that in almost all
instances where the Alien Act has been enforced,
the sentence of exclusion was a just one; it was
such as the circumstances of the case abundantly
bore out. Either the word was not idiomatic,
or was not intelligible, or was not needed, or
looked ill, or sounded ill, or some other valid
reason existed against it. A lover of his native
tongue will tremble to think what that tongue
would have become, if all the vocables from
the Latin and the Greek which were then introduced
or endorsed by illustrious names, had been
admitted on the strength of their recommendation;
if ‘torve’ and ‘tetric’ (Fuller), ‘cecity’
(Hooker), ‘fastide’ and ‘trutinate’ (<i>State Papers</i>),
‘immanity’ (Shakespeare), ‘insulse’ and ‘insulsity’
(Milton, prose), ‘scelestick’ (Feltham),
‘splendidious’ (Drayton), ‘pervicacy’ (Baxter),
‘stramineous’, ‘ardelion’ (Burton), ‘lepid’ and
‘sufflaminate’ (Barrow), ‘facinorous’ (Donne),
‘immorigerous’, ‘clancular’, ‘ferity’, ‘ustulation’,
‘stultiloquy’, ‘lipothymy’ (<span title="Greek: leipothymia">λειποθυμία</span>),
‘hyperaspist’ (all in Jeremy Taylor), if ‘mulierosity’,
‘subsannation’, ‘coaxation’, ‘ludibund<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>ness’,
‘delinition’, ‘septemfluous’, ‘medioxumous’,
‘mirificent’, ‘palmiferous’ (all in Henry
More), ‘pauciloquy’ and ‘multiloquy’ (Beaumont,
<i>Psyche</i>); if ‘dyscolous’ (Foxe), ‘ataraxy’
(Allestree), ‘moliminously’ (Cudworth), ‘luciferously’
(Sir Thomas Browne), ‘immarcescible’
(Bishop Hall), ‘exility’, ‘spinosity’, ‘incolumity’,
‘solertiousness’, ‘lucripetous’, ‘inopious’,
‘eluctate’, ‘eximious’ (all in Hacket), ‘arride’<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a>
(ridiculed by Ben Johnson), with the hundreds
of other words like these, and even more monstrous
than are some of these, not to speak of such
Italian as ‘leggiadrous’ (a favourite word in
Beaumont’s <i>Psyche</i>), ‘amorevolous’ (Hacket),
had not been rejected and disallowed by the true
instinct of the national mind.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Naturalization of Words</i></div>

<p>A great many too <i>were</i> allowed and adopted,
but not exactly in the shape in which they first
were introduced among us; they were made to
drop their foreign termination, or otherwise
their foreign appearance, to conform themselves
to English ways, and only so were finally incorporated
into the great family of English words<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a>.
Thus of Greek words we have the following:
‘pyramis’ and ‘pyramides’, forms often employed
by Shakespeare, became ‘pyramid’ and
‘pyramids’; ‘dosis’ (Bacon) ‘dose’; ‘distichon’
(Holland) ‘distich’; ‘hemistichion’ (North)
‘hemistich’; ‘apogæon’ (Fairfax) and ‘apogeum’
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>(Browne) ‘apogee’; ‘sumphonia’ (Lodge) ‘symphony’;
‘prototypon’ (Jackson) ‘prototype’;
‘synonymon’ (Jeremy Taylor) or ‘synonymum’
(Hacket), and ‘synonyma’ (Milton, prose),
became severally ‘synonym’ and ‘synonyms’;
‘syntaxis’ (Fuller) became ‘syntax’; ‘extasis’
(Burton) ‘ecstasy’; ‘parallelogrammon’ (Holland)
‘parallelogram’; ‘programma’ (Warton)
‘program’; ‘epitheton’ (Cowell) ‘epithet’;
‘epocha’ (South) ‘epoch’; ‘biographia’ (Dryden)
‘biography’; ‘apostata’ (Massinger) ‘apostate’;
‘despota’ (Fox) ‘despot’; ‘misanthropos’ (Shakespeare)
if ‘misanthropi’ (Bacon) ‘misanthrope’;
‘psalterion’ (North) ‘psaltery’; ‘chasma’ (Henry
More) ‘chasm’; ‘idioma’ and ‘prosodia’ (both
in Daniel, prose) ‘idiom’ and ‘prosody’; ‘energia’,
‘energy’, and ‘Sibylla’, ‘Sibyl’ (both in
Sidney); ‘zoophyton’ (Henry More) ‘zoophyte’;
‘enthousiasmos’ (Sylvester) ‘enthusiasm’; ‘phantasma’
(Donne) ‘phantasm’; ‘magnes’ (Gabriel
Harvey) ‘magnet’; ‘cynosura’ (Donne) ‘cynosure’;
‘galaxias’ (Fox) ‘galaxy’; ‘heros’ (Henry
More) ‘hero’; ‘epitaphy’ (Hawes) ‘epitaph’.</p>

<p>The same process has gone on in a multitude
of Latin words, which testify by their terminations
that they were, and were felt to be, Latin at
their first employment; though now they are
such no longer. Thus Bacon uses generally,
I know not whether always, ‘insecta’ for ‘insects’;
and ‘chylus’ for ‘chyle’; Bishop Andrews ‘nardus’
for ‘nard’; Spenser ‘zephyrus’, and not ‘zephyr’;
so ‘interstitium’ (Fuller) preceded ‘interstice’;
‘philtrum’ (Culverwell) ‘philtre’; ‘expansum’
(Jeremy Taylor) ‘expanse’; ‘preludium’ (Beau<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>mont,
<i>Psyche</i>), ‘prelude’; ‘precipitium’ (Coryat)
‘precipice’; ‘aconitum’ (Shakespeare) ‘aconite’;
‘balsamum’ (Webster) ‘balsam’; ‘heliotropium’
(Holland) ‘heliotrope’; ‘helleborum’ (North)
‘hellebore’; ‘vehiculum’ (Howe) ‘vehicle’; ‘trochæus’
and ‘spondæus’ (Holland) ‘trochee’
and ‘spondee’; and ‘machina’ (Henry More)
‘machine’. We have ‘intervalla’, not ‘intervals’,
in Chillingworth; ‘postulata’, not ‘postulates’,
in Swift; ‘archiva’, not ‘archives’, in
Baxter; ‘demagogi’, not ‘demagogues’, in
Hacket; ‘vestigium’, not ‘vestige’, in Culverwell;
‘pantomimus’ in Lord Bacon for ‘pantomime’;
‘mystagogus’ for ‘mystagogue’, in Jackson;
‘atomi’ in Lord Brooke for ‘atoms’;
‘ædilis’ (North) went before ‘ædile’; ‘effigies’
and ‘statua’ (both in Shakespeare) before
‘effigy’ and ‘statue’; ‘abyssus’ (Jackson) before
‘abyss’; ‘vestibulum’ (Howe) before ‘vestibule’;
‘symbolum’ (Hammond) before ‘symbol’;
‘spectrum’ (Burton) before ‘spectre’; while only
after a while ‘quære’ gave place to ‘query’;
‘audite’ (Hacket) to ‘audit’; ‘plaudite’ (Henry
More) to ‘plaudit’; and the low Latin ‘mummia’
(Webster) became ‘mummy’. The widely extended
change of such words as ‘innocency’,
‘indolency’, ‘temperancy’, and the large family
of words with the same termination, into ‘innocence’,
‘indolence’, ‘temperance’, and the like,
can only be regarded as part of the same process
of entire naturalization.</p>

<p>The plural very often tells the secret of a word,
and of the light in which it is regarded by those
who employ it, when the singular, being less<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
capable of modification, would have failed to
do so; thus when Holland writes ‘phalanges’,
‘bisontes’, ‘ideæ’, it is clear that ‘phalanx’,
‘bison’, ‘idea’, were still Greek words for him;
as ‘dogma’ was for Hammond, when he made its
plural not ‘dogmas’, but ‘dogmata’<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a>; and
when Spenser uses ‘heroes’ as a trisyllable, it
plainly is not yet thoroughly English for him<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a>.
‘Cento’ is not English, but a Latin word used
in English, so long as it makes its plural not
‘centos’, but ‘centones’, as in the old anonymous
translation of Augustin’s <i>City of God</i><a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a>;
and ‘specimen’, while it makes its plural
‘specimina’ (Howe). Pope making, as he does,
‘satellites’ a quadrisyllable in the line</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Why Jove’s <i>satellites</i> are less than Jove”,<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>must have felt that he was still dealing with it as
Latin; just as ‘terminus’, a word which the
necessities of railways have introduced among us,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
will not be truly naturalized till we use ‘terminuses’,
and not ‘termini’ for its plural; nor
‘phenomenon’, till we have renounced ‘phenomena’.
Sometimes it has been found convenient
to retain both plurals, that formed according
to the laws of the classical language, and that
formed according to the laws of our own, only
employing them in different senses; thus is it with
‘indices’ and ‘indexes’, ‘genii’ and ‘geniuses’.</p>

<p>The same process has gone on with words
from other languages, as from the Italian and
the Spanish; thus ‘bandetto’ (Shakespeare),
‘bandito’ (Jeremy Taylor), becomes ‘bandit’;
‘ruffiano’ (Coryat) ‘ruffian’; ‘concerto’, ‘concert’;
‘busto’ (Lord Chesterfield) ‘bust’;
‘caricatura’ (Sir Thomas Browne) ‘caricature’;
‘princessa’ (Hacket) ‘princess’; ‘scaramucha’
(Dryden) ‘scaramouch’; ‘pedanteria’ (Sidney)
‘pedantry’; ‘impresa’ ‘impress’; ‘caprichio’
(Shakespeare) becomes first ‘caprich’ (Butler),
then ‘caprice’; ‘duello’ (Shakespeare) ‘duel’;
‘alligarta’ (Ben Jonson), ‘alligator’; ‘parroquito’
(Webster) ‘parroquet’; ‘scalada’ (Heylin)
or ‘escalado’ (Holland) ‘escalade’; ‘granada’
(Hacket) ‘grenade’; ‘parada’ (J. Taylor)
‘parade’; ‘emboscado’ (Holland) ‘stoccado’,
‘barricado’, ‘renegado’, ‘hurricano’ (all in
Shakespeare), ‘brocado’ (Hackluyt), ‘palissado’
(Howell), drop their foreign terminations, and
severally become ‘ambuscade’, ‘stockade’,
‘barricade’, ‘renegade’, ‘hurricane’, ‘brocade’,
‘palisade’; ‘croisado’ in like manner (Bacon)
becomes first ‘croisade’ (Jortin), and then
‘crusade’; ‘quinaquina’ or ‘quinquina’, ‘quinine’.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>Other slight modifications of spelling, not in
the termination, but in the body of a word,
will indicate in like manner its more entire
incorporation into the English language.
Thus ‘shash’, a Turkish word, becomes ‘sash’;
‘colone’ (Burton) ‘clown’<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a>; ‘restoration’ was
at first spelt ‘rest<i>au</i>ration’; and so long as
‘vicinage’ was spelt ‘voisinage’<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> (Sanderson),
‘mirror’ ‘miroir’ (Fuller), ‘recoil’ ‘recule’,
or ‘career’ ‘carriere’ (both by Holland), they
could scarcely be considered those purely English
words which now they are<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a>.</p>

<p>Here and there even at this comparatively late
period of the language awkward foreign words will
be recast in a more thoroughly English mould;
‘chirurgeon’ will become ‘surgeon’; ‘hemorrhoid’,
‘emerod’; ‘squinancy’ will become first
‘squinzey’ (Jeremy Taylor) and then ‘quinsey’;
‘porkpisce’ (Spenser), that is sea-hog, or more
accurately hogfish<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> will be ‘porpesse’, and then
‘porpoise’, as it is now. In other words the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
attempt will be made, but it will be now too late
to be attended with success. ‘Physiognomy’ will
not give place to ‘visnomy’, however Spenser and
Shakespeare employ this briefer form; nor ‘hippopotamus’
to ‘hippodame’, even at Spenser’s
bidding. In like manner the attempt to naturalize
‘avant-courier’ in the shape of ‘vancurrier’
has failed. Other words also we meet which have
finally refused to take a more popular form,
although such was once more or less current; or,
if this is too much to say of all, yet hazarded by
good authors. Thus Holland wrote ‘cirque’, but
we ‘circus’; ‘cense’, but we ‘census’; ‘interreign’,
but we ‘interregnum’; Sylvester ‘cest’,
but we ‘cestus’; ‘quirry’, but we ‘equerry’;
‘colosse’, but we still ‘colossus’; Golding ‘ure’,
but we ‘urus’; ‘metropole’, but we ‘metropolis’;
Dampier ‘volcan’, but this has not superseded
‘volcano’; nor ‘pagod’ (Pope) ‘pagoda’; nor
‘skelet’ (Holland) ‘skeleton’; nor ‘stimule’
(Stubbs) ‘stimulus’. Bolingbroke wrote ‘exode’,
but we hold fast to ‘exodus’; Burton ‘funge’,
but we ‘fungus’; Henry More ‘enigm’, but we
‘enigma’; ‘analyse’, but we ‘analysis’. ‘Superfice’
(Dryden) has not put ‘superficies’, nor ‘sacrary’
(Hacket) ‘sacrarium’, nor ‘limbeck’
‘alembic’, out of use. Chaucer’s ‘potecary’ has
given way to a more Greek formation ‘apothecary’.
Yet these and the like must be regarded quite as
exceptions; the tendency of things is altogether
the other way.</p>

<p>Looking at this process of the reception of
foreign words, with their after assimilation in
feature to our own, we may trace, as was to be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
expected, a certain conformity between the genius
of our institutions and that of our language. It
is the very character of our institutions to repel
none, but rather to afford a shelter and a refuge
to all, from whatever quarter they come; and after
a longer or shorter while all the strangers and
incomers have been incorporated into the English
nation, within one or two generations have forgotten
that they were ever ought else than members
of it, have retained no other reminiscence of
their foreign extraction than some slight difference
of name, and that often disappearing or having
disappeared. Exactly so has it been with the
English language. No language has shown itself
less exclusive; none has stood less upon niceties;
none has thrown open its arms wider, with a fuller
confidence, a confidence justified by experience,
that it could make truly its own, assimilate and
subdue to itself, whatever it received into its
bosom; and in none has this experiment in a
larger number of instances been successfully
carried out.</p>

<hr class="small" />

<div class="sidenote"><i>French at the Restoration</i></div>

<p>Such are the two great enlargements from
without of our vocabulary. All other are minor
and subordinate. Thus the introduction of French
tastes by Charles the Second and his courtiers
returning from exile, to which I have just adverted,
though it rather modified the structure of our sentences
than the materials of our vocabulary, gave
us some new words. In one of Dryden’s plays, <i>Marriage
à la Mode</i>, a lady full of affectation is introduced,
who is always employing French idioms
in preference to English, French words rather<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
than native. It is not a little curious that of
these, thus put into her mouth to render her
ridiculous, not a few are excellent English now,
and have nothing far-sought or affected about
them: for so it frequently proves that what is
laughed at in the beginning, is by all admitted
and allowed at the last. For example, to speak
of a person being in the ‘good graces’ of another
has nothing in it ridiculous now; the words
‘repartee’, ‘embarrass’, ‘chagrin’, ‘grimace’, do
not sound novel and affected now as they all must
plainly have done at the time when Dryden wrote.
‘Fougue’ and ‘fraischeur’, which he himself employed&mdash;being,
it is true, no frequent offender in
this way&mdash;have not been justified by the same
success.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Greek Words Naturalized</i></div>

<p>Nor indeed can it be said that this adoption
and naturalization of foreign words ever ceases in
a language. There are periods, as we have seen,
when this goes forward much more largely than at
others; when a language throws open, as it were,
its doors, and welcomes strangers with an especial
freedom; but there is never a time, when one
by one these foreigners and strangers are not
slipping into it. We do not for the most part
observe the fact, at least not while it is actually
doing. Time, the greatest of all innovators,
manages his innovations so dexterously, spreads
them over such vast periods, and therefore brings
them about so gradually, that often, while effecting
the mightiest changes, we have no suspicion that
he is effecting any at all. Thus how imperceptible
are the steps by which a foreign word is admitted
into the full rights of an English one; the process<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
of its incoming often eluding our notice altogether.
There are numerous Greek words, for example
which, quite unchanged in form, have in one
way or another ended in finding a home and
acceptance among us. We may in almost every
instance trace step by step the naturalization
of one of these; and the manner of this singularly
confirms what has just been said. We can note
it spelt for a while in Greek letters, and avowedly
employed as a Greek and not an English vocable;
then after it had thus obtained a certain allowance
among us, and become not altogether unfamiliar,
we note it exchanging its Greek for English letters,
and finally obtaining recognition as a word
which however drawn from a foreign source, is
yet itself English. Thus ‘acme’, ‘apotheosis’,
‘criterion’, ‘chrysalis’, ‘encyclopedia’, ‘metropolis’,
‘opthalmia’, ‘pathos’, ‘phenomena’,
are all now English words, while yet South with
many others always wrote <span title="Greek: akmê">ἀκμή</span>, Jeremy Taylor
<span title="Greek: apotheôsis">ἀποθέωσις</span> and
<span title="Greek: kritêrion">κριτήριον</span>, Henry More
<span title="Greek: chrysalis">χρυσαλίς</span>,
Ben Jonson speaks of ‘the knowledge of the
liberal arts, which the Greeks call
<span title="Greek: enkyklopadeian">ἐγκυκλοπαδείαν</span>’<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a>,
Culverwell wrote <span title="Greek: mêtropolis">μητρόπολις</span>
and <span title="Greek: ophthalmia">ὀφθαλμία</span>, Preston,
<span title="Greek: phainomena">φαινόμενα</span>&mdash;Sylvester

not ‘pathos’, but <span title="Greek: pathos">πάθος</span><a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a>.
<ins class="correction" title="Greek: Êthos;
original reads ‘Ἡθος’">Ἠθος</ins> is a word at
the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
present moment preparing for a like passage
from Greek characters to English, and certainly
before long will be acknowledged as an English
word<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a>.
The only cause which has hindered
this for some time past is the misgiving whether
it will not be read ‘ĕthos,’ and not ‘ēthos,’
and thus not be the word intended.</p>

<p>Let us trace a like process in some French
word, which is at this moment becoming English.
I know no better example than the French ‘prestige’
will afford. ‘Prestige’ has manifestly no
equivalent in our own language; it expresses
something which no single word in English, which
only a long circumlocution, could express; namely,
that magic influence on others, which past successes
as the pledge and promise of future ones, breed.
The word has thus naturally come to be of very
frequent use by good English writers; for they do
not feel that in employing it they are passing by
as good or a better word of their own. At first
all used it avowedly as French, writing it in italics
to indicate this. At the present moment some
write it so still, some do not; some, that is, regard
it still as foreign, others consider that it has now
become English, and obtained a settlement
among us<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a>.
Little by little the number of
those<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
who write it in italics will become fewer and
fewer, till they cease altogether. It will then
only need that the accent should be shifted, in
obedience to the tendencies of the English language,
as far back in the word as it will go, that
instead of ‘prestíge’, it should be pronounced
‘préstige’ even as within these few years instead
of ‘depót’ we have learned to say ‘dépot’, and its
naturalization will be complete. I have little
doubt that in twenty years it will be so pronounced
by the majority of well educated
Englishmen<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a>,&mdash;some
pronounce it so already,&mdash;and that our
present pronunciation will pass away in the
same manner as ‘obl<i>ee</i>ge’, once universal, has
past away, and everywhere given place to
‘obl<i>i</i>ge’<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Shifting of Accents</i></div>

<p>Let me here observe in passing, that the process
of throwing the accent of a word back, by way
of completing its naturalization, is one which
we may note constantly going forward in our
language. Thus, while Chaucer accentuates sometimes
‘natúre’, he also accentuates elsewhere
‘náture’, while sometimes ‘virtúe’, at other times
‘<ins class="correction" title="original reads ‘vìrtue’">vírtue</ins>’.
‘Prostrate’, ‘adverse’, ‘aspect’, ‘process’,
‘insult’, ‘impulse’, ‘pretext’, ‘contrite’,
‘uproar’, ‘contest’, had all their accent on the
last syllable in Milton; they have it now on the
first; ‘cháracter’ was
‘<ins class="correction" title="original reads ‘hcáracter’">charácter</ins>’ with
Spenser;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
‘théatre’ was ‘theátre’ with Sylvester; while
‘acádemy’ was accented ‘académy’ by Cowley
and Butler<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a>. ‘Essay’ was ‘essáy’ with Dryden
and with Pope; the first closes an heroic line
with the word; Pope does the same with ‘barrier’<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a>
and ‘effort’; therefore pronounced ‘barríer’,
‘effórt’, by him.</p>

<p>There are not a few other French words which
like ‘prestige’ are at this moment hovering on the
verge of English, hardly knowing whether they
shall become such, or no. Such are ‘ennui’,
‘exploitation’, ‘verve’, ‘persiflage’, ‘badinage’,
‘chicane’, ‘finesse’, and others; all of them often
employed by us,&mdash;and it is out of such frequent
employment that adoption proceeds,&mdash;because
expressing shades of meaning not expressed by any
words of our own<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a>. Some of these, we may confidently
anticipate, will complete their naturalization;
others will after a time retreat again, and
become for us avowedly French. ‘Solidarity’, a
word which we owe to the French Communists,
and which signifies a fellowship in gain and loss,
in honour and dishonour, in victory and defeat, a
being, so to speak, all in the same bottom, is so
convenient, that unattractive as confessedly it is,
it will be in vain to struggle against its reception.
The newspapers already have it, and books will
not long exclude it; not to say that it has esta<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>blished
itself in German, and probably in other
European languages as well.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Greek in English</i></div>

<p>Greek and Latin words also we still continue to
adopt, although now no longer in troops and companies,
but only one by one. With the lively
interest which always has been felt in classical
studies among us, and which will continue to be
felt, so long as any greatness and nobleness survive
in our land, it must needs be that accessions
from these quarters would never cease altogether.
I do not refer here to purely scientific terms;
these, so long as they continue such, and do not
pass beyond the threshold of the science or sciences
for the use of which they were invented, being
never heard on the lips, or employed in the writings,
of any but the cultivators of these sciences, have
no right to be properly called words at all. They
are a kind of shorthand of the science, or algebraic
notation; and will not find place in a dictionary
of the language, constructed upon true principles,
but rather in a technical dictionary apart by themselves.
Of these, compelled by the advances of
physical science, we have coined multitudes out of
number in these later times, fashioning them
mainly from the Greek, no other language within
our reach yielding itself at all so easily to our
needs.</p>

<p>Of non-scientific words, both Greek and Latin,
some have made their way among us quite in
these latter times. Burke in the House of Commons
is said to have been the first who employed
the word ‘inimical’<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a>.
He also launched the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
verb ‘to spheterize’ in the sense of to appropriate
or make one’s own; but this without success.
Others have been more fortunate; ‘æsthetic’ we
have got indeed <i>through</i> the Germans, but <i>from</i>
the Greeks. Tennyson has given allowance to
‘æon’<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a>;
and ‘myth’ is a deposit which wide
and far-reaching controversies have left in the
popular language. ‘Photography’ is an example
of what I was just now speaking of&mdash;namely, a
scientific word which has travelled beyond the
limits of the science which it designates and which
gave it birth. ‘Stereotype’ is another word of
the same character. It was invented&mdash;not the
thing, but the word,&mdash;by Didot not very long since;
but it is now absorbed into healthy general circulation,
being current in a secondary and figurative
sense. Ruskin has given to ‘ornamentation’
the sanction and authority of his name. ‘Normal’
and ‘abnormal’, not quite so new, are yet of
recent introduction into the language<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>German Importations</i></div>

<p>When we consider the near affinity between
the English and German languages, which, if not
sisters, may at least be regarded as first cousins,
it is somewhat remarkable that almost since the
day when they parted company, each to fulfil its
own destiny, there has been little further com<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>merce
between them in the matter of giving or
taking. At any rate adoptions on our part
from the German have been till within this period
extremely rare. ‘Crikesman’ (Kriegsmann) and
‘brandschat’ (Brandschatz), with some other
German words common enough in the <i>State Papers</i>
of the sixteenth century, found no permanent place
in the language. The explanation lies in the
fact that the literary activity of Germany did
not begin till very late, nor our interest in it till
later still, not indeed till the beginning of the
present century. Yet ‘plunder’, as I have
mentioned elsewhere, was brought back from
Germany about the beginning of our Civil Wars,
by the soldiers who had served under Gustavus
Adolphus and his captains<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a>. And ‘trigger’,
written ‘tricker’ in <i>Hudibras</i> is manifestly the
German ‘drücker’<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a>, though none of our dictionaries
have marked it as such; a word first appearing
at the same period, it may have reached us through
the same channel. ‘Iceberg’ (eisberg) also we
must have taken whole from the German, as, had
we constructed the word for ourselves, we should<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
have made it not ‘ice<i>berg</i>’, but ‘ice-<i>mountain</i>’.
I have not found it in our earlier voyagers, often
as they speak of the ‘icefield’, which yet is not
exactly the same thing. An English ‘swindler’
is not exactly a German ‘schwindler’, yet the
notion of the ‘nebulo’, though more latent in
the German, is common to both; and we must
have drawn the word from Germany<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> (it is not
an old one in our tongue) during the course of the
last century. If ‘<i>life</i>-guard’ was originally, as
Richardson suggests, ‘<i>leib</i>-garde’, or ‘<i>body</i>-guard’,
and from that transformed, by the
determination of Englishmen to make it significant
in English, into ‘<i>life</i>-guard’, or guard
defending the <i>life</i> of the sovereign, this will
be another word from the same quarter. Yet
I have my doubts; ‘leibgarde’ would scarcely
have found its way hither before the accession of
the House of Hanover, or at any rate before the
arrival of Dutch William with his memorable
guards; while ‘lifeguard’, in its present shape,
is certainly an older word in the language; we
hear often of the ‘lifeguards’ in our Civil Wars;
as witness too Fuller’s words: “The Cherethites
were a kind of <i>lifegard</i> to king David”<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a>.</p>

<p>Of late our German importations have been
somewhat more numerous. With several German
compound words we have been in recent times
so<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
well pleased, that we must needs adopt them into
English, or imitate them in it. We have not
always been very happy in those which we have
selected for imitation or adoption. Thus we might
have been satisfied with ‘manual’, and not called
back from its nine hundred years of oblivion that
ugly and unnecessary word ‘handbook’. And
now we are threatened with ‘word-building’, as
I see a book announced under the title of “Latin
<i>word-building</i>”, and, much worse than this, with
‘stand-point’. ‘Einseitig’ (itself a modern word,
if I mistake not, or at any rate modern in its
secondary application) has not, indeed, been
adopted, but is evidently the pattern on which we
have formed ‘onesided’&mdash;a word to which a few
years ago something of affectation was attached;
so that any one who employed it at once gave
evidence that he was more or less a dealer in
German wares; it has however its manifest conveniences,
and will hold its ground. ‘Fatherland’
(Vaterland) on the contrary will scarcely establish
itself among us, the note of affectation will continue
to cleave to it, and we shall go on contented
with ‘native country’ to the
end<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a>. The most
successful of these compounded words, borrowed
recently from the German, is ‘folk-lore’, and the
substitution of this for popular superstitions, must
be esteemed, I think, an unquestionable
gain<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a>.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>To speak now of other sources from which the
new words of a language are derived. Of course
the period when absolutely new roots are generated
will have past away, long before men begin
by a reflective act to take any notice of processes
going forward in the language which they speak.
This pure productive energy, creative we might
call it, belongs only to the earlier stages of a
nation’s existence,&mdash;to times quite out of the ken
of history. It is only from materials already
existing either in its own bosom, or in the bosom
of other languages, that it can enrich itself in the
later, or historical stages of its life.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Compound Words</i></div>

<p>And first, it can bring its own words into new
combinations; it can join two, and sometimes
even more than two, of the words which it already
has, and form out of them a new one. Much
more is wanted here than merely to attach two
or more words to one another by a hyphen; this
is not to make a new word: they must really
coalesce and grow together. Different languages,
and even the same language at different stages of
its existence, will possess this power of forming
new words by the combination of old in very
different degrees. The eminent felicity of the
Greek in this respect has been always acknowledged.
“The joints of her compounded words”, says
Fuller, “are so naturally oiled, that they run
nimbly on the tongue, which makes them though
long, never tedious, because
significant”<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a>.
Sir<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
Philip Sidney boasts of the capability of our
English language in this respect&mdash;that “it is particularly
happy in the composition of two or three
words together, near equal to the Greek”. No
one has done more than Milton to justify this
praise, or to make manifest what may be effected
by this marriage of words. Many of his compound
epithets, as ‘golden-tressed’, ‘tinsel-slippered’,
‘coral-paven’, ‘flowry-kirtled’, ‘violet-embroidered’,
‘vermeil-tinctured’, are themselves poems<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
in miniature. Not unworthy to be set beside
these are Sylvester’s “<i>opal-coloured</i> morn”, Drayton’s
“<i>silver-sanded</i> shore”, and perhaps Marlowe’s
“<i>golden-fingered</i> Ind”<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a>.</p>

<p>Our modern inventions in the same kind are for
the most part very inferior: they could hardly
fail to be so, seeing that the formative, plastic
powers of a language are always waning and
diminishing more and more. It may be, and
indeed is, gaining in other respects, but in this
it is losing; and thus it is not strange if its later
births in this kind are less successful than its
earlier. Among the poets of our own time Shelley
has done more than any other to assert for the
language that it has not quite renounced this
power; while among writers of prose in these
later days Jeremy Bentham has been at once one
of the boldest, but at the same time one of the
most unfortunate, of those who have issued this
money from their mint. Still we ought not to
forget, while we divert ourselves with the strange
and formless progeny of his brain, that we owe
‘international’ to him&mdash;a word at once so convenient
and supplying so real a need, that it
was, and with manifest advantage, at once adopted
by all<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Adjectives ending in al</i></div>

<p>Another way in which languages increase their
stock of vocables is by the forming of new words
according to the analogy of formations, which in
seemingly parallel cases have been already allowed.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
Thus long since upon certain substantives such as
‘congregation’, ‘convention’, were formed their
adjectives, ‘congregational’, ‘conventional’; yet
these also at a comparatively modern period; ‘congregational’
first rising up in the Assembly of
Divines, or during the time of the Commonwealth<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a>.
These having found admission into the language,
it is attempted to repeat the process in the case of
other words with the same ending. I confess the
effect is often exceedingly disagreeable. We are
now pretty well used to ‘educational’, and the
word is sometimes serviceable enough; but I can
perfectly remember when some twenty years ago
an “<i>Educational</i> Magazine” was started, the
first impression on one’s mind was, that a work
having to do with education should not thus
bear upon its front an offensive, or to say the
best, a very dubious novelty in the English language<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a>.
These adjectives are now multiplying
fast. We have ‘inflexional’, ‘seasonal’, ‘denominational’,
and, not content with this, in dissenting
magazines at least, the monstrous birth,
‘denominationalism’; ‘emotional’ is creeping
into books<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a>, ‘sensational’, and others as well,
so that it is hard to say where this influx will stop,
or whether all our words with this termination
will not finally generate an adjective. Convenient
as you may sometimes find these, I would yet<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
certainly counsel you to abstain from all but the
perfectly well <ins class="correction" title="original reads ‘recognised’">recognized</ins>
formations of this kind.
There may be cases of exception; but for the
most part Pope’s advice is good, as certainly it
is safe, that we be not among the last to use a
word which is going out, nor among the first to
employ one that is coming in.</p>

<p>‘Starvation’ is another word of comparatively
recent introduction, formed in like manner on the
model of preceding formations of an apparently
similar character&mdash;its first formers, indeed, not
observing that they were putting a Latin termination
to a Saxon word. Some have supposed it to
have reached us from America. It has not however
travelled from so great a distance, being a
stranger indeed, yet not from beyond the Atlantic,
but only from beyond the Tweed. It is an old
Scottish word, but unknown in England, till used
by Mr. Dundas, the first Viscount Melville, in an
American debate in 1775. That it then jarred
strangely on English ears is evident from the nickname,
“<i>Starvation</i> Dundas”, which in consequence
he obtained<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Revival of Words</i></div>

<p>Again, languages enrich themselves, our own has
done so, by recovering treasures which for a while
had been lost by them or forgone. I do not mean
that all which drops out of use <i>is</i> loss; there are
words which it is gain to be rid of; which it would
be folly to wish to revive; of which Dryden,
setting himself against an extravagant zeal in this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
direction, says in an ungracious comparison&mdash;they
do “not deserve this redemption, any more than the
crowds of men who daily die, or are slain for sixpence
in a battle, merit to be restored to life, if a
wish could revive them”<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a>. There are others,
however, which it is a real gain to draw back
again from the temporary oblivion which had
overtaken them; and this process of their setting
and rising again, or of what, to use another image,
we might call their suspended animation, is not
so unfrequent as at first might be supposed.</p>

<p>You may perhaps remember that Horace, tracing
in a few memorable lines the history of words,
while he notes that many once current have now
dropped out of use, does not therefore count that
of necessity their race is for ever run; on the
contrary he confidently anticipates a <i>palingenesy</i>
for many among them<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a>; and I am convinced that
there has been such in the case of our English
words to a far greater extent than we are generally
aware. Words slip almost or quite as imperceptibly
back into use as they once slipped out of it.
Let me produce a few facts in evidence of this. In
the contemporary gloss which an anonymous
friend of Spenser’s furnished to his <i>Shepherd’s
Calendar</i>, first published in 1579, “for the exposition
of old words”, as he declares, he thinks
it expedient to include in his list, the following,
‘dapper’, ‘scathe’, ‘askance’, ‘sere’, ‘embellish’,
‘bevy’, ‘forestall’, ‘fain’, with not a few others
quite as familiar as these. In Speght’s <i>Chaucer<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></i>
(1667), there is a long list of “old and obscure
words in Chaucer explained”; including ‘anthem’,
‘blithe’, ‘bland’, ‘chapelet’, ‘carol’, ‘deluge’,
‘franchise’, ‘illusion’, ‘problem’, ‘recreant’,
‘sphere’, ‘tissue’, ‘transcend’, with very many
easier than these. In Skinner’s <i>Etymologicon</i> (1671),
there is another list of obsolete, words<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a>, and
among these he includes ‘to dovetail’, ‘to interlace’,
‘elvish’, ‘encombred’, ‘masquerade’ (mascarade),
‘oriental’, ‘plumage’, ‘pummel’ (pomell),
and ‘stew’, that is, for fish. Who will
say of the verb ‘to hallow’ that it is now even
obsolescent? and yet Wallis two hundred years ago
observed&mdash;“It has almost gone out of use” (fer.
desuevit). It would be difficult to find an example
of the verb, ‘to advocate’, between Milton
and Burke<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a>.
Franklin, a close observer in such
matters, as he was himself an admirable master
of English style, considered the word to have
sprung up during his own residence in Europe.
In this indeed he was mistaken; it had only
during this period revived<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a>. Johnson says of
‘jeopardy’ that it is a “word not now in use”;
which certainly is not any longer true<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a>.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Dryden and Chaucer’s English</i></div>

<p>I am persuaded that in facility of being understood,
Chaucer is not merely as near, but much
nearer, to us than Dryden and his cotemporaries
felt him to be to them. He and the writers of his
time make exactly the same sort of complaints,
only in still stronger language, about his archaic
phraseology and the obscurities which it involves,
that are made at the present day. Thus in the
<i>Preface</i> to his <i>Tales from Chaucer</i>, having quoted
some not very difficult lines from the earlier poet
whom he was modernizing, he proceeds: “You
have here a specimen of Chaucer’s language, which
is so obsolete that his sense is scarce to be understood”.
Nor was it merely thus with respect of
Chaucer. These wits and poets of the Court of
Charles the Second were conscious of a greater
gulf between themselves and the Elizabethan era,
separated from them by little more than fifty
years, than any of which <i>we</i> are aware, separated
from it by nearly two centuries more. I do not
mean merely that they felt themselves more removed
from its tone and spirit; their altered circumstances
might explain this; but I am convinced
that they found a greater difficulty and
strangeness in the language of Spenser and
<ins class="correction" title="original reads ‘Shakesspeare’">Shakespeare</ins>
than we find now; that it sounded in many
ways more uncouth, more old-fashioned, more
abounding in obsolete terms than it does in our
ears at the present. Only in this way can I explain<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
the tone in which they are accustomed to speak
of these worthies of the near past. I must again
cite Dryden, the truest representative of literary
England in its good and in its evil during the last
half of the seventeenth century. Of Spenser,
whose death was separated from his own birth by
little more than thirty years, he speaks as of one
belonging to quite a different epoch, counting it
much to say, “Notwithstanding his obsolete language,
he is still intelligible”<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a>. Nay, hear what
his judgment is of Shakespeare himself, so far as
language is concerned: “It must be allowed to
the present age that the tongue in general is
so much refined since Shakespeare’s time, that
many of his words and more of his phrases are
scarce intelligible. And of those which we understand,
some are ungrammatical, others coarse;
and his whole style is so pestered with figurative
expressions, that it is as affected as it is obscure”<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Nugget</i>, <i>Ingot</i></div>

<p>Sometimes a word will emerge anew from the
undercurrent of society, not indeed new, but yet
to most seeming as new, its very existence having
been altogether forgotten by the larger number of
those speaking the language; although it must
have somewhere lived on upon the lips of men.
Thus, for instance, since the Californian and Australian
discoveries of gold we hear often of a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
‘nugget’ of gold; being a lump of the pure metal;
and there has been some discussion whether the
word has been born for the present necessity, or
whether it be a recent malformation of ‘ingot’,
I am inclined to think that it is neither one nor
the other. I would not indeed affirm that it may
not be a popular recasting of ‘ingot’; but only
that it is not a recent one; for ‘nugget’ very
nearly in its present form, occurs in our elder
writers, being spelt ‘niggot’ by them<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a>. There
can be little doubt of the identity of ‘niggot’ and
‘nugget’; all the consonants, the <i>stamina</i> of a
word, being the same; while this early form
‘niggot’ makes more plausible their suggestion
that ‘nugget’ is only ‘ingot’ disguised, seeing
that there wants nothing but the very common
transposition of the first two letters to bring that
out of this<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Words from Proper Names</i></div>

<p>New words are often formed from the names
of persons, actual or mythical. Some one has observed
how interesting would be a complete collection,
or a collection approaching to completeness,
in any language of the names of <i>persons</i> which
have afterwards become names of <i>things</i>, from
‘nomina <i>appellativa</i>’ have become ‘nomina<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
<i>realia</i>’<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a>. Let me without confining myself to
those of more recent introduction endeavour to
enumerate as many as I can remember of the
words which have by this method been introduced
into our language. To begin with mythical
antiquity&mdash;the Chimæra has given us ‘chimerical’,
Hermes ‘hermetic’, Tantalus ‘to tantalize’,
Hercules ‘herculean’, Proteus ‘protean’, Vulcan
‘volcano’ and ‘volcanic’, and Dædalus ‘dedal’,
if this word may on Spenser’s and Shelley’s authority
be allowed. Gordius, the Phrygian king who
tied that famous ‘gordian’ knot which Alexander
cut, will supply a natural transition from mythical
to historical. Here Mausolus, a king of Caria,
has left us ‘mausoleum’, Academus ‘academy’,
Epicurus ‘epicure’, Philip of Macedon a ‘philippic’,
being such a discourse as Demosthenes once
launched against the enemy of Greece, and Cicero
‘cicerone’. Mithridates, who had made himself
poison-proof, gave us the now forgotten word
‘mithridate’, for antidote; as from Hippocrates
we derived ‘hipocras’, or ‘ypocras’, a word often
occurring in our early poets, being a wine supposed
to be mingled after his receipt. Gentius, a king
of Illyria, gave his name to the plant ‘gentian’,
having been, it is said, the first to discover its
virtues. A grammar used to be called a ‘donnat’,
or ‘donet’ (Chaucer), from Donatus, a famous
grammarian. Lazarus, perhaps an actual person,
has given us ‘lazar’ and ‘lazaretto’; St. Vero<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>nica
and the legend connected with her name,
a ‘vernicle’; being a napkin with the Saviour’s
face portrayed on it; Simon Magus ‘simony’; Mahomet
a ‘mammet’ or ‘maumet’, meaning an
<ins class="correction" title="comma not visible in original">idol<a
name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a>,</ins>
and ‘mammetry’ or idolatry; ‘dunce’ is from
Duns Scotus; while there is a legend that the
‘knot’ or sandpiper is named from Canute or
Knute, with whom this bird was a special favourite.
To come to more modern times, and not
pausing at Ben Johnson’s ‘chaucerisms’, Bishop
Hall’s ‘scoganisms’, from Scogan, Edward the
Fourth’s jester, or his ‘aretinisms’, from
<ins class="correction" title="original reads ‘an,’">an</ins>
infamous writer, ‘a poisonous Italian ribald’
as Gabriel Harvey calls him, named Aretine;
these being probably not intended even by their
authors to endure; a Roman cobbler named
Pasquin has given us the ‘pasquil’ or ‘pasquinade’;
‘patch’ in the sense of fool, and often so
used by Shakespeare, was originally the proper
name of a favourite fool of Cardinal Wolsey<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a>;
Colonel Negus in Queen Anne’s time first mixed
the beverage which goes by his name; Lord
Orrery was the first for whom an ‘orrery’ was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
constructed; and Lord Spencer first wore, or
at least first brought into fashion, a ‘spencer’.
Dahl, a Swede, introduced the cultivation of the
‘dahlia’, and M. Tabinet, a French Protestant
refugee, the making of the stuff called ‘tabinet’ in
Dublin; in ‘<i>tram</i>-road’, the second syllable of the
name of Ou<i>tram</i>, the inventor,
survives<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a>. The
‘tontine’ was conceived by an Italian named
Tonti; and another Italian, Galvani, first noted
the phenomena of animal electricity or ‘galvanism’;
while a third Italian, ‘Volta’, gave a name
to the ‘voltaic’ battery. ‘Martinet’, ‘mackintosh’,
‘doyly’, ‘brougham’, ‘to macadamize’,
‘to burke’, are all names of persons or
from persons, and then transferred to things, on
the score of some connection existing between
the one and other<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a>.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>Again the names of popular characters in
literature, such as have taken strong hold on the
national mind, give birth to a number of new words.
Thus from Homer we have ‘mentor’ for a monitor;
‘stentorian’, for loud-voiced; and inasmuch as with
all of Hector’s nobleness there is a certain amount
of big talking about him, he has given us ‘to
hector’<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a>;
while the medieval romances about
the siege of Troy ascribe to Pandarus that shameful
ministry out of which his name has past into
the words ‘to pandar’ and ‘pandarism’. ‘Rodomontade’
is from Rodomont, a blustering and
boasting hero of Boiardo, adopted by Ariosto;
‘thrasonical’, from Thraso, the braggart of the
Roman comedy. Cervantes has given us ‘quixotic’;
Swift ‘lilliputian’; to Molière the French
language owes ‘tartuffe’ and ‘tartufferie’. ‘Reynard’
too, which with us is a duplicate for fox,
while in the French ‘renard’ has quite excluded
the older ‘volpils’, was originally not the name
of a kind, but the proper name of the fox-hero,
the vulpine Ulysses, in that famous beast-epic of
the middle ages, <i>Reineke Fuchs</i>; the immense
popularity of which we gather from many evidences,
from none more clearly than from this.
‘Chanticleer’ is in like manner the proper name
of the cock, and ‘Bruin’ of the bear in the same
poem<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a>.
These have not made fortune to
the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
same extent of actually putting out in any language
the names which before existed, but still
have become quite familiar to us all.</p>

<p>We must not count as new words properly so
called, although they may delay us for a minute,
those comic words, most often comic combinations
formed at will, and sometimes of enormous length,
in which, as plays and displays of power, great
writers ancient and modern have delighted. These
for the most part are meant to do service for the
moment, and then to pass away<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a>. The inventors
of them had themselves no intention of fastening
them permanently on the language. Thus among
the Greeks Aristophanes coined <span title="Greek: mellonikiaô">μελλονικιάω</span>, to
loiter like Nicias, with allusion to the delays with
which this prudent commander sought to put off
the disastrous Sicilian expedition, with not a few
other familiar to every scholar. The humour of
them sometimes consists in their enormous length,
as in the <span title="Greek: amphiptolemopêdêsistratos">ἀμφιπτολεμοπηδησίστρατος</span> of Eupolis;
the <span title="Greek: spermagoraiolekitholachanopôlis">σπερμαγοραιολεκιθολαχανόπωλις</span> of Aristophanes;
sometimes in their mingled observance
and transgression of the laws of the language, as in
the ‘oculissimus’ of Plautus, a comic superlative
of ‘oculus’; ‘occisissimus’ of ‘occisus’; as in the
‘dosones’, ‘dabones’, which in Greek and in
medieval Latin were names given to those who
were ever promising, ever saying “I will give”
but never performing their promise. Plautus
with his exuberant wit, and exulting in his mastery
and command of the Latin language, will compose
four or five lines consisting entirely of comic com<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>binations
thrown off for the occasion<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a>. Of the
same character is Butler’s ‘cynarctomachy’, or
battle of a dog and bear. Nor do I suppose that
Fuller, when he used ‘to avunculize’, to imitate
or follow in the steps of one’s uncle, or Cowper,
when he suggested ‘extraforaneous’ for out of
doors, in the least intended them as lasting additions
to the language.</p>

<div class="sidenote">‘<i>To Chouse</i>’</div>

<p>Sometimes a word springs up in a very curious
way; here is one, not having, I suppose, any great
currency except among schoolboys; yet being no
invention of theirs, but a genuine English word,
though of somewhat late birth in the language, I
mean ‘to chouse’. It has a singular origin. The
word is, as I have mentioned already, a Turkish
one, and signifies ‘interpreter’. Such an interpreter
or ‘chiaous’ (written ‘chaus’ in Hackluyt,
‘chiaus’ in Massinger), being attached to the
Turkish embassy in England, committed in the
year 1609 an enormous fraud on the Turkish and
Persian merchants resident in London. He succeeded
in cheating them of a sum amounting to
£4000&mdash;a sum very much greater at that day
than at the present. From the vast dimensions of
the fraud, and the notoriety which attended it,
any one who cheated or defrauded was said ‘to
chiaous’, ‘chause’, or ‘chouse’; to do, that is, as
this ‘chiaous’ had done<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a>.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Different Spelling of Words</i></div>

<p>There is another very fruitful source of new
words in a language, or perhaps rather another
way in which it increases its vocabulary, for a
question might arise whether the words thus produced
ought to be called new. I mean through
the splitting of single words into two or even more.
The impulse and suggestion to this is in general
first given by varieties in pronunciation, which
are presently represented by varieties in spelling;
but the result very often is that what at first
were only precarious and arbitrary differences in
this, come in the end to be regarded as entirely
different words; they detach themselves from one
another, not again to reunite; just as accidental
varieties in fruits or flowers, produced at hazard,
have yet permanently separated off, and settled
into different kinds. They have each its own distinct
domain of meaning, as by general agreement
assigned to it; dividing the inheritance between
them, <ins class="correction" title="original reads ‘whith’">which</ins>
hitherto they held in common. No
one who has not had his attention called to this
matter, who has not watched and catalogued these
words as they have come under his notice, would
at all believe how numerous they are.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Doublets</i></div>

<p>Sometimes as the accent is placed on one syllable
of a word or another, it comes to have different
significations, and those so distinctly marked,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
that the separation may be regarded as complete.
Examples of this are the following: ‘dívers’,
and ‘divérse’; ‘cónjure’ and ‘conjúre’; ‘ántic’
and ‘antíque’; ‘húman’ and ‘humáne’; ‘úrban’
and ‘urbáne’; ‘géntle’ and ‘gentéel’; ‘cústom’
and ‘costúme’; ‘éssay’ and ‘assáy’; ‘próperty’
and ‘propríety’. Or again, a word is pronounced
with a full sound of its syllables, or somewhat
more shortly: thus ‘spirit’ and ‘sprite’; ‘blossom’
and ‘bloom’<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a>; ‘personality’ and ‘personalty’;

‘balm’; ‘eremite’ and ‘hermit’; ‘nighest’ and
‘next’; ‘poesy’ and ‘posy’; ‘fragile’ and ‘frail’;
‘achievement’ and ‘hatchment’; ‘manœuvre’
and ‘manure’;&mdash;or with the dropping of the first
syllable: ‘history’ and ‘story’; ‘etiquette’ and
‘ticket’; ‘escheat’ and ‘cheat’; ‘estate’ and
‘state’; and, older probably than any of these,
‘other’ and ‘or’;&mdash;or with a dropping of the last
syllable, as ‘Britany’ and ‘Britain’; ‘crony’ and
‘crone’;&mdash;or without losing a syllable, with more
or less stress laid on the close: ‘regiment’ and
‘regimen’; ‘corpse’ and ‘corps’; ‘bite’ and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
‘bit’; ‘sire’ and ‘sir’; ‘land’ or ‘laund’ and
‘lawn’; ‘suite’ and ‘suit’; ‘swinge’ and ‘swing’;
‘gulph’ and ‘gulp’; ‘launch’ and ‘lance’;
‘wealth’ and ‘weal’; ‘stripe’ and ‘strip’;
‘borne’ and ‘born’; ‘clothes’ and ‘cloths’;&mdash;or
a slight internal vowel change finds place, as
between ‘dent’ and ‘dint’; ‘rant’ and ‘rent’
(a ranting actor tears or <i>rends</i> a passion to
tatters)<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a>;

‘Frances’<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a>; ‘chivalry’ and ‘cavalry’; ‘oaf’
and ‘elf’; ‘lose’ and ‘loose’; ‘taint’ and ‘tint’.
Sometimes the difference is mainly or entirely
in the initial consonants, as between ‘phial’ and
‘vial’; ‘pother’ and ‘bother’; ‘bursar’ and
‘purser’; ‘thrice’ and ‘trice’<a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a>; ‘shatter’ and
‘scatter’; ‘chattel’ and ‘cattle’; ‘chant’
and ‘cant’; ‘zealous’ and ‘jealous’; ‘channel’
and ‘kennel’; ‘wise’ and ‘guise’; ‘quay’
and ‘key’; ‘thrill’, ‘trill’ and ‘drill’;&mdash;or
in the consonants in the middle of the word,
as between ‘cancer’ and ‘canker’; ‘nipple’ and
‘nibble’; ‘tittle’ and ‘title’; ‘price’ and ‘prize’;
‘consort’ and ‘concert’;&mdash;or there is a change in
both, as between ‘pipe’ and ‘fife’.</p>

<p>Or a word is spelt now with a final <i>k</i> and now
with a final <i>ch</i>; out of this variation two different
words have been formed; with, it may be, other
slight differences superadded; thus is it with
‘poke’ and ‘poach’; ‘dyke’ and ‘ditch’; ‘stink’
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>and ‘stench’; ‘prick’ and ‘pritch’ (now obsolete);
‘break’ and ‘breach’; to which may be
added ‘broach’; ‘lace’ and ‘latch’; ‘stick’ and
‘stitch’; ‘lurk’ and ‘lurch’; ‘bank’ and ‘bench’;
‘stark’ and ‘starch’; ‘wake’ and ‘watch’.
So too <i>t</i> and <i>d</i> are easily exchanged; as in ‘clod’
and ‘clot’; ‘vend’ and ‘vent’; ‘brood’ and
‘brat’<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a>;
‘halt’ and ‘hold’; ‘sad’ and
‘set’<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a>;
‘card’ and ‘chart’; ‘medley’ and ‘motley’.
Or there has grown up, besides the rigorous and
accurate pronunciation of a word, a popular as
well; and this in the end has formed itself into
another word; thus is it with ‘housewife’ and
‘hussey’; ‘hanaper’ and ‘hamper’; ‘puisne’
and ‘puny’; ‘patron’ and ‘pattern’; ‘spital’
(hospital) and ‘spittle’ (house of correction);
‘accompt’ and ‘account’; ‘donjon’ and ‘dungeon’;
‘nestle’ and ‘nuzzle’<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> (now obsolete);
‘Egyptian’ and ‘gypsy’; ‘Bethlehem’ and
‘Bedlam’; ‘exemplar’ and ‘sampler’; ‘dolphin’
and ‘dauphin’; ‘iota’ and ‘jot’.</p>

<p>Other changes cannot perhaps be reduced exactly
under any of these heads; as between
‘ounce’ and ‘inch’; ‘errant’ and ‘arrant’;
‘slack’ and ‘slake’; ‘slow’ and
‘slough’<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a>;
‘bow’ and ‘bough’; ‘hew’ and ‘hough’<a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a>;
‘dies’ and ‘dice’ (both plurals of ‘die’); ‘plunge’
and ‘flounce’<a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a>; ‘staff’ and ‘stave’; ‘scull’
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>and
‘shoal’; ‘benefit’ and
‘benefice’<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a>. Or, it
may be, the difference which constitutes the two
forms of the word into two words is in the spelling
only, and of a character to be appreciable only by
the eye, escaping altogether the ear: thus it is
with ‘draft’ and ‘draught’; ‘plain’ and ‘plane’;
‘coign’ and ‘coin’; ‘flower’ and ‘flour’; ‘check’
and ‘cheque’; ‘straight’ and ‘strait’; ‘ton’ and
‘tun’; ‘road’ and ‘rode’; ‘throw’ and ‘throe’;
‘wrack’ and ‘rack’; ‘gait’ and ‘gate’; ‘hoard’
and ‘horde’<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a>; ‘knoll’ and ‘noll’; ‘chord’ and
‘cord’; ‘drachm’ and ‘dram’; ‘sergeant’ and
‘serjeant’; ‘mask’ and ‘masque’; ‘villain’ and
‘villein’.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Words in Two Forms</i></div>

<p>Now, if you will put the matter to proof, you
will find, I believe, in every case that there has
attached itself to the different forms of a word a
modification of meaning more or less sensible, that
each has won for itself an independent sphere of
meaning, in which it, and it only, moves. For
example, ‘divers’ implies difference only, but
‘diverse’ difference with opposition; thus the
several Evangelists narrate the same event in
‘divers’ manner, but not in ‘diverse’. ‘Antique’
is ancient, but ‘antic’, is now the ancient
regarded as overlived, out of date, and so in our
days grotesque, ridiculous; and then, with a dropping
of the reference to age, the grotesque, the
ridiculous alone. ‘Human’ is what every man
is, ‘humane’ is what every man ought to be; for
Johnson’s suggestion that ‘humane’ is from the
French feminine, ‘humaine’, and ‘human’ from
the masculine, cannot for an instant be admitted.
‘Ingenious’ expresses a mental, ‘ingenuous’ a
moral, excellence<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a>. A gardener ‘prunes’, or
trims his trees, properly indeed his <i>vines</i> alone
(pro<i>vigner</i>), birds ‘preen’ or trim their feathers.
We ‘allay’ wine with water; we ‘alloy’ gold
with platina. ‘Bloom’ is a finer and more delicate
efflorescence even than ‘blossom’; thus the
‘bloom’, but not the ‘blossom’, of the cheek.
It is now always ‘clots’ of blood and ‘clods’ of
earth; a ‘float’ of timber, and a ‘fleet’ of ships;
men ‘vend’ wares, and ‘vent’ complaints. A
‘curtsey’ is one, and that merely an external,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
manifestation of ‘courtesy’. ‘Gambling’ may be,
as with a fearful irony it is called, <i>play</i>, but it is
nearly as distant from ‘gambolling’ as hell is
from heaven<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a>. Nor would it be hard, in almost
every pair or larger group of words which I have
adduced, as in others which no doubt might be
added to complete the list, to trace a difference of
meaning which has obtained a more or less distinct
recognition<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a>.</p>

<p>But my subject is inexhaustible; it has no
limits except those, which indeed may be often<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
narrow enough, imposed by my own ignorance on
the one side; and on the other, by the necessity
of consulting your patience, and of only choosing
such matter as will admit a popular setting forth.
These necessities, however, bid me to pause, and
suggest that I should not look round for other
quarters from whence accessions of new words are
derived. Doubtless I should not be long without
finding many such. I must satisfy myself for the
rest with a very brief consideration of the <i>motives</i>
which, as they have been, are still at work among
us, inducing us to seek for these augmentations of
our vocabulary.</p>

<p>And first, the desire of greater clearness is a
frequent motive and inducement to this. It has
been well and truly said: “Every new term,
expressing a fact or a difference not precisely or
adequately expressed by any other word in the
same language, is a new organ of thought for the
mind that has learned it”<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a>. The limits of their
vocabulary are in fact for most men the limits of
their knowledge; and in a great degree for us all.
Of course I do not affirm that it is absolutely impossible
to have our mental conceptions clearer
and more distinct than our words; but it is very
hard to have, and still harder to keep, them so.
And therefore it is that men, conscious of this,
so soon as ever they have learned to distinguish
in their minds, are urged by an almost irresistible
impulse to distinguish also in their words. They
feel that nothing is made sure till this is done.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Dissimilation of Words</i></div>

<p>The sense that a word covers too large a space
of meaning, is the frequent occasion of the intro<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>duction
of another, which shall relieve it of a
portion of this. Thus, there was a time when
‘witch’ was applied equally to male and female
dealers in unlawful magical arts. Simon Magus,
for example, and Elymas are both ‘witches’, in
Wiclif’s <i>New Testament</i> (Acts viii. 9; xiii. 8), and
Posthumus in <i>Cymbeline</i>: but when the medieval
Latin ‘sortiarius’ (not ‘sortitor’ as in Richardson),
supplied another word, the French ‘sorcier’, and
thus our English ‘sorcerer’ (originally the “caster
of lots”), then ‘witch’ gradually was confined to
the hag, or female practiser of these arts, while
‘sorcerer’ was applied to the male.</p>

<p>New necessities, new evolutions of society into
more complex conditions, evoke new words; which
come forth, because they are required now; but
did not formerly exist, because they were not
required in the period preceding. For example,
in Greece so long as the poet sang his own verses
‘singer’ (<span title="Greek: aoidos">ἀοιδὸς</span>)
sufficiently expressed the double
function; such a ‘singer’ was Homer, and such
Homer describes Demodocus, the bard of the
Phæacians; that double function, in fact, not
being in his time contemplated as double, but
each part of it so naturally completing the other,
that no second word was required. When, however,
in the division of labour one made the verses
which another chaunted, then ‘poet’ or ‘maker’,
a word unknown in the Homeric age, arose. In
like manner, when ‘physicians’ were the only
natural philosophers, the word covered this meaning
as well as that other which it still retains;
but when the investigation of nature and natural
causes detached itself from the art of healing,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
became an independent study of itself, the name
‘physician’ remained to that which was as the
stock and stem of the art, while the new offshoot
sought out a new name for itself.</p>

<p>Another motive to the invention of new words,
is the desire thereby to cut short
lengthy<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> explanations,
tedious circuits of language. Science is often
an immense gainer by words, which say singly
what it would have taken whole sentences otherwise
to have said. Thus ‘isothermal’ is quite of
modern invention; but what a long story it would
be to tell the meaning of ‘<i>isothermal</i> lines’, all
which is summed up in and saved by the word.
We have long had the word ‘assimilation’ in our
dictionaries; ‘dissimilation’ has not yet found its
way into them, but it speedily will. It will appear
first, if it has not already appeared, in our books
on language<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a>.
I express myself with this confidence,
because the advance of philological enquiry
has rendered it almost a matter of necessity
that we should possess a word to designate a certain
process, and no other word would designate
it at all so well. There is a process of ‘assimilation’
going on very extensively in language; it
occurs where the organs of speech find themselves
helped by changing a letter for another which has
just occurred, or will just occur in a word; thus<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
we say not ‘<i>adf</i>iance’ but ‘<i>aff</i>iance’, not ‘re<i>n</i>ow<i>m</i>’,
as our ancestors did when the word
‘renommée’ was first naturalized, but ‘re<i>n</i>ow<i>n</i>’.
At the same time there is another opposite process,
where some letter would recur too often for euphony
or comfort in speaking, if the strict form of the
word were too closely held fast, and where consequently
this letter is exchanged for some other,
generally for some nearly allied; thus it is at
least a reasonable suggestion, that ‘cœ<i>r</i>uleum’
was once ‘cœ<i>l</i>uleum’, from cœlum: so too the
Italians prefer ‘ve<i>l</i>e<i>n</i>o’ to ‘ve<i>n</i>e<i>n</i>o’; and we
‘cinnamo<i>n</i>’ to ‘cinnamo<i>m</i>’ (the earlier form);
in ‘turtle’ and ‘purple’ we have shrunk from
the double ‘<i>r</i>’ of ‘turtur’ and ‘purpura’; and
this process of <i>making unlike</i>, requiring a term to
express it, will create, or indeed has created, the
word ‘dissimilation’, which probably will in
due time establish itself among us in far wider
than its primary use.</p>

<p>‘Watershed’ has only recently begun to appear
in books of geography; and yet how convenient
it must be admitted to be; how much more so
than ‘line of water parting’, which it has succeeded;
meaning, as I need hardly tell you it does,
not merely that which <i>sheds</i> the waters, but that
which <i>divides</i> them (‘wasserscheide’); and being
applied to that exact ridge and highest line in a
mountain region, where the waters of that region
separate off and divide, some to one side, and some
to the other; as in the Rocky Mountains of North
America there are streams rising within very few
miles of one another, which flow severally east and
west, and, if not in unbroken course, yet as afflu<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>ents
to larger rivers, fall at least severally into the
Pacific and Atlantic oceans. It must be allowed,
I think, that not merely geographical terminology,
but geography itself, had a benefactor in
him who first endowed it with so expressive and
comprehensive a word, bringing before us a fact
which we should scarcely have been aware of
without it.</p>

<p>There is another word which I have just employed,
‘affluent’, in the sense of a stream which
does not flow into the sea, but joins a larger stream,
as for instance, the Isis is an ‘affluent’ of the
Thames, the Moselle of the Rhine. It is itself an
example in the same kind of that whereof I have
been speaking, having been only recently constituted
a substantive, and employed in this sense,
while yet its utility is obvious. ‘Confluents’
would perhaps be a fitter name, where the rivers,
like the Missouri and the
<ins class="correction" title="original reads ‘Missisippi’">Mississippi</ins>, were of equal
or nearly equal importance up to the time of their
meeting<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">‘<i>Selfishness</i>’, ‘<i>Suicide</i>’</div>

<p>Again, new words are coined out of the necessity
which men feel of filling up gaps in the language.
Thoughtful men, comparing their own language
with that of other nations, become conscious of
deficiencies, of important matters unexpressed in
their own, and with more or less success proceed
to supply the deficiency. For example, that sin
of sins, the undue love of self, with the postponing
of the interests of all others to our own, had for a
long time no word to express it in English. Help
was sought from the Greek, and from the Latin.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
‘Philauty’ (<span title="Greek: philautia">φιλαυτία</span>)
had been more than once
attempted by our scholars; but found no popular
acceptance. This failing, men turned to the Latin;
one writer trying to supply the want by calling
the man a ‘suist’, as one seeking <i>his own</i> things
(‘sua’), and the sin itself, ‘suicism’. The gap,
however, was not really filled up, till some of the
Puritan writers, drawing on our Saxon, devised
‘selfish’ and ‘selfishness’, words which to us
seem obvious enough, but which yet are little more
than two hundred [and fifty] years
old<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a>.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Notices of New Words</i></div>

<p>Before quitting this part of the subject, let me
say a few words in conclusion on this deliberate
introduction of words to supply felt omissions<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
in a language, and the limits within which this
or any other conscious interference with the
development of a language is desirable or possible.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
By the time that a people begin to meditate upon
their language, to be aware by a conscious reflective
act either of its merits or deficiencies, by far the
greater and more important part of its work is
done; it is fixed in respect of its structure in
immutable forms; the region in which any alteration
or modification, addition to it, or
<ins class="correction" title="so in original">substraction</ins>
from it, deliberately devised and carried out,
may be possible, is very limited indeed. Its
great laws are too firmly established to admit of
this; so that almost nothing can be taken from
it, which it has got; almost nothing added to it,
which it has <i>not</i> got. It will travel indeed in
certain courses of change; but it would be as
easy almost to alter the career of a planet as for
man to alter these. This is sometimes a subject
of regret with those who see what they believe
manifest defects or blemishes in their language,
and such as appear to them capable of remedy.
And yet in fact this is well; since for once that
these redressers of real or fancied wrongs, these
suppliers of things lacking, would have
<ins class="correction" title="comma not visible in original">mended,</ins>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>we may be tolerably confident that ten times,
yea, a hundred times, they would have marred;
letting go that which would have been well retained;
retaining that which by a necessary law
the language now dismisses and lets go; and in
manifold ways interfering with those processes
of a natural logic, which are here evermore at
work. The genius of a language, unconsciously
presiding over all its transformations, and conducting
them to a definite issue, will have been
a far truer, far safer guide, than the artificial wit,
however subtle, of any single man, or of any association
of men. For the genius of a language is
the sense and inner conviction of all who speak it,
as to what it ought to be, and the means by which
it will best attain its objects; and granting that
a pair of eyes, or two or three pairs of eyes may
see much, yet millions of eyes will certainly see
more.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>German Purists</i></div>

<p>It is only with the words, and not with the
forms and laws of a language, that any interference
such as I have just supposed is possible.
Something, indeed much, may here be done by
wise masters, in the way of rejecting that which
would deform, allowing and adopting that which
will strengthen and enrich. Those who would
purify or enrich a language, so long as they have
kept within this their proper sphere, have often
effected much, more than at first could have
seemed possible. The history of the German language
affords so much better illustration of this
than our own would do, that I shall make no
scruple in seeking my examples there. When the
patriotic Germans began to wake up to a conscious<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>ness
of the enormous encroachments which foreign
languages, the Latin and French above all, had
made on their native tongue, the lodgements which
they had therein effected, and the danger which
threatened it, namely, that it should cease to be
German at all, but only a mingle-mangle, a variegated
patchwork of many languages, without any
unity or inner coherence at all, various societies
were instituted among them, at the beginning
and during the course of the seventeenth century,
for the recovering of what was lost of their own,
for the expelling of that which had intruded from
abroad; and these with excellent effect.</p>

<p>But more effectual than these societies were
the efforts of single men, who in this merited well
of their country<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a>. In respect of words which
are now entirely received by the whole nation,
it is often possible to designate the writers who
first substituted them for some affected Gallicism
or unnecessary Latinism. Thus to Lessing his
fellow-countrymen owe the substitution of ‘zartgefühl’
for ‘delicatesse’, of ‘empfindsamkeit’
for ‘sentimentalität’, of ‘wesenheit’ for ‘essence’.
It was Voss (1786) who first employed ‘alterthümlich’
for ‘antik’. Wieland too was the author
or reviver of a multitude of excellent words, for
which often he had to do earnest battle at the
first; such were ‘seligkeit’, ‘anmuth’, ‘entzückung’,
‘festlich’, ‘entwirren’, with many
more. For ‘maskerade’, Campe would have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
fain substituted ‘larventanz’. It was a novelty
when Büsching called his great work on geography
‘erdbeschreibung’ instead of ‘geographie’;
while ‘schnellpost’ instead of ‘diligence’, ‘zerrbild’
for ‘carricatur’ are also of recent introduction.
In regard of ‘wörterbuch’ itself, J.
Grimm tells us he can find no example of its use
dating earlier than 1719.</p>

<p>Yet at the same time it must be acknowledged
that some of these reformers proceeded with
more zeal than knowledge, while others did whatever
in them lay to make the whole movement
absurd&mdash;even as there ever hang on the skirts
of a noble movement, be it in literature or politics
or higher things yet, those who contribute their
little all to bring ridicule and contempt upon it.
Thus in the reaction against foreign interlopers
which ensued, and in the zeal to purify the language
from them, some went to such extravagant
excesses as to desire to get rid of ‘testament’,
‘apostel’, which last Campe would have replaced
by ‘lehrbote’, with other words like these, consecrated
by longest use, and to find native substitutes
in their room; or they understood so little
what words deserved to be called foreign, or how
to draw the line between them and native, that
they would fain have gotten rid of ‘vater’, ‘mutter’,
‘wein’, ‘fenster’, ‘meister’, ‘kelch’<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a>;
the first three of which belong to the German
language by just as good a right as they do to the
Latin and the Greek; while the other three have
been naturalized so long that to propose to expel<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
them now was as if, having passed an alien act
for the banishment of all foreigners, we should
proceed to include under that name, and as such
drive forth from the kingdom, the descendants of
the French Protestants who found refuge here at
the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes, or even of
the Flemings who settled among us in the time of
our Edwards. One notable enthusiast in this line
proposed to create an entirely new nomenclature
for all the mythological personages of the Greek
and the Roman pantheon, who, one would think,
might have been allowed, if any, to retain their
Greek and Latin names. So far however from
this, they were to exchange these for equivalent
German titles; Cupid was to be ‘Lustkind’,
Flora ‘Bluminne’, Aurora ‘Röthin’; instead
of Apollo schoolboys were to speak of ‘Singhold’;
instead of Pan of ‘Schaflieb’; instead of Jupiter of
‘Helfevater’, with much else of the same kind.
Let us beware (and the warning extends much
further than to the matter in hand) of making a
good cause ridiculous by our manner of supporting
it, of assuming that exaggerations on one
side can only be redressed by exaggerations as
great upon the other.</p>

We may observe exactly the same in Plautus: a
multitude of Greek words are used by him, which the
Latin language did not want, and therefore refused to
take up; thus ‘clepta’, ‘zamia’ (<span title="Greek: zêmia">ζημία</span>), ‘danista’,
‘harpagare’, ‘apolactizare’, ‘nauclerus’, ‘strategus’,
‘morologus’, ‘phylaca’, ‘malacus’, ‘sycophantia’,
‘euscheme’ (<span title="Greek: euschêmôs">εὐσχήμως</span>),
‘dulice’ (<span title="Greek: doulikôs">δουλικῶς</span>), [so ‘scymnus’

except by him; ‘mastigias’ and ‘techna’ appear also
in Terence. Yet only experience could show that they
were superfluous; and at the epoch of Latin literature
in which Plautus lived, it was well done to put them on

We have notable evidence in some lines of Waller of
the sense which in his time scholars had of the rapidity
with which the language was changing under their hands.
Looking back at what the last hundred years had wrought
of alteration in it, and very naturally assuming that the
next hundred would effect as much, he checked with
misgivings such as these his own hope of immortality:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Who can hope his lines should long<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Last in a daily changing tongue?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While they are new, envy prevails,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And as that dies, our language fails.<br /></span>
</div>

<span class="spaced">&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</span>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Poets that lasting marble seek,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Must carve in Latin or in Greek:<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>We</i> write in sand; our language grows,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And like the tide our work o’erflows”.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Such were his misgivings as to the future, assuming that
the rate of change would continue what it had been. How
little they have been fulfilled, every one knows. In actual
fact two centuries, which have elapsed since he wrote,
have hardly antiquated a word or a phrase in his poems.
If we care very little for them now, that is to be explained
by quite other causes&mdash;by the absence of all moral earnestness
from them.</p></div>

And so too in French it is surprising to find of how
late introduction are many words, which it seems as if
the language could never have done without. ‘Désintéressement’,
‘exactitude’, ‘sagacité’, ‘bravoure’, were
not introduced till late in the seventeenth century. ‘Renaissance’,
‘emportement’, ‘sçavoir-faire’, ‘indélébile’,
‘désagrément’, were all recent in 1675 (Bouhours);
‘indévot’, ‘intolérance’, ‘impardonnable’, ‘irréligieux’,
were struggling into allowance at the end of the
seventeenth century, and were not established till the
beginning of the eighteenth. ‘Insidieux’ was invented
by Malherbe; ‘frivolité’ does not appear in the earlier
editions of the <i>Dictionary of the Academy</i>; the Abbé de
St. Pierre was the first to employ ‘bienfaisance’, the
elder Balzac ‘féliciter’, Sarrasin ‘burlesque’. Mad.
de Sevigné exclaims against her daughter for employing
‘effervescence’ in a letter (comment dites-vous cela, ma
fille? Voilà un mot dont je n’avais jamais ouï parler).
‘Demagogue’ was first hazarded by Bossuet, and was
counted so bold a novelty that it was long before any
ventured to follow him in its use. Somewhat earlier
Montaigne had introduced ‘diversion’ and ‘enfantillage’,
though not without being rebuked by cotemporaries
on the score of the last. Desfontaines was the first
who employed ‘suicide’; Caron gave to the language
‘avant-propos’, Ronsard ‘avidité’, Joachim Dubellay
‘patrie’, Denis Sauvage ‘jurisconsulte’, Menage ‘gracieux’
(at least so Voltaire affirms) and ‘prosateur’,
Desportes ‘pudeur’, Chapelain ‘urbanité’, and Etienne
first brought in, apologizing at the same time for the
boldness of it, ‘analogie’ (si les oreilles françoises peuvent
porter ce mot). ‘Préliber’ (prælibare) is a word
of our own day; and it was Charles Nodier who, if he
did not coin, yet revived the obsolete ‘simplesse’.&mdash;See

Have we here an explanation of the ‘battalia’ of
Jeremy Taylor and others? Did they, without reflecting
on the matter, regard ‘battalion’ as a word with a Greek
neuter termination? It is difficult to think they should
have done so; yet more difficult to suggest any other
explanation. [‘Battalia’ was sometimes mistaken as a
plural, which indeed it was originally, the word being
derived through the Italian <i>battaglia</i>, from low Latin
<i>battalia</i>, which (like <i>biblia</i>, <i>gaudia</i>, etc.) was afterwards
regarded as a feminine singular (Skeat, <i>Principles</i>, ii,
230). But Shakespeare used it as a singular, “Our
<i>battalia</i> trebles that account” (<i>Rich. III</i>, v. 3, 11); and
so Sir T. Browne, “The Roman <i>battalia</i> was ordered after
this manner” (<i>Garden of Cyrus</i>, 1658, p. 113).]</p></div>

<i>Holy State</i>, b. 2, c. 6. There was a time when the
Latin promised to display, if not an equal, yet not a very
inferior, freedom in this forming of new words by the
happy marriage of old. But in this, as in so many respects,
it seemed possessed at the period of its highest
culture with a timidity, which caused it voluntarily to
abdicate many of its own powers. Where do we find
in the Augustan period of the language so grand a pair
of epithets as these, occurring as they do in a single line
of Catullus: Ubi cerva <i>silvicultrix</i>, ubi aper <i>nemorivagus</i>?
or again, as his ‘fluentisonus’? Virgil’s vitisator (<i>Æn.</i>
7, 179) is not his own, but derived from one of the earlier
poets. Nay, the language did not even retain those
compound epithets which it once had formed, but was
content to let numbers of them drop: ‘parcipromus’;
‘turpilucricupidus’, and many more, do not extend
beyond Plautus. On this matter Quintilian observes
(i. 5, 70): Res tota magis Græcos decet, nobis minus
succedit; nec id fieri naturâ puto, sed alienis favemus;
ideoque cum <span title="Greek: kyrtauchena">κυρταύχενα</span> mirati sumus, <i>incurvicervicum</i>
vix a risu defendimus. Elsewhere he complains, though
not with reference to compound epithets, of the little
<i>generative</i> power which existed in the Latin language,
that its continual losses were compensated by no equivalent
gains (viii. 6, 32): Deinde,
<ins class="correction" title="so in original; probable error for ‘tamquam consumpta’">tanquum consummata</ins>
sint omnia, nihil generare audemus ipsi, quum multa
quotidie ab antiquis ficta moriantur. Notwithstanding
this complaint, it must be owned that the silver age of
the language, which sought to recover, and did recover
to some extent the abdicated energies of its earlier times,
reasserted among other powers that of combining words
with a certain measure of success.</p></div>

Of their own they have ‘sardanapalisme’, any piece of
profuse luxury, from Sardanapalus; while for ‘lambiner’,
to dally or loiter over a task, they are indebted to Denis
Lambin, a worthy Greek scholar of the sixteenth century,
whom his adversaries accused of sluggish movement and
wearisome diffuseness in style. Every reader of Pascal’s
<i>Provincial Letters</i> will remember Escobar, the great
casuist among the Jesuits, whose convenient subterfuges
for the relaxation of the moral law have there been made
famous. To the notoriety which he thus acquired he
owes his introduction into the French language; where
‘escobarder’ is used in the sense of to equivocate, and
‘escobarderie’ of subterfuge or equivocation. The name
of an unpopular minister of finance, M. de Silhouette,
unpopular because he sought to cut down unnecessary
expenses in the state, was applied to whatever was cheap,
and, as was implied, unduly economical; it has survived
in the black outline portrait which is now called a ‘silhouette’.
(Sismondi, <i>Histoire des Français</i>, tom. xix,

of Mansart, the architect who introduced it. I need

Were there need of proving that these both lie in
‘beneficium’, which there is not, for in Wiclif’s translation
of the Bible the distinction is still latent (1 Tim. vi. 2),
one might adduce a singularly characteristic little trait
of Papal policy, which once turned upon the double use
of this word. Pope Adrian the Fourth writing to the
Emperor Frederic the First to complain of certain conduct
of his, reminded the Emperor that he had placed the
imperial crown upon his head, and would willingly have
conferred even greater ‘beneficia’ upon him than this.
Had the word been allowed to pass, it would no doubt
have been afterwards appealed to as an admission on the
Emperor’s part, that he held the Empire as a feud or fief
(for ‘beneficium’ was then the technical word for this,
though the meaning had much narrowed since) from
the Pope&mdash;the very point in dispute between them.
The word was indignantly repelled by the Emperor and
the whole German nation, whereupon the Pope appealed
to the etymology, that ‘beneficium’ was but ‘bonum
factum’, and protested that he meant no more than to
remind the Emperor of the ‘benefits’ which he had done
him, and which he would have willingly multiplied still
more. [‘Benefice’ from Latin <i>beneficium</i>, and ‘benefit’
from Latin <i>bene-factum</i>, are here confused.]</p></div>

The same happens in other languages. Thus in
Greek ‘<ins class="correction" title="Greek: anathema;
original reads ‘ἀνάθέμα’">ἀνάθεμα</ins>’ and
‘<span title="Greek: anathêma">ἀνάθημα</span>’ both signify that which
is devoted, though in very different senses, to the gods;
‘<span title="Greek: tharsos">θάρσος</span>’, boldness, and
‘<span title="Greek: thrasos">θράσος</span>’, temerity, were no
more at first than different spellings of the same word;
not otherwise is it with
<span title="Greek: gripos">γρῖπος</span> and
<span title="Greek: griphos">γρῖφος</span>,
<span title="Greek: ethos">ἔθος</span> and
<span title="Greek: êthos">ἦθος</span>,
<span title="Greek: brykô">βρύκω</span> and
<span title="Greek: brychô">βρύχω</span>, while
<span title="Greek: obelos">ὀβελὸς</span> and
<span title="Greek: obolos">ὀβολὸς</span>,
<span title="Greek: soros">σορὸς</span> and
<span title="Greek: sôros">σωρὸς</span>,
are probably the same words. So too in Latin
‘penna’ and ‘pinna’ differ only in form, and signify
alike a ‘wing’; while yet ‘penna’ has come to be used
for the wing of a bird, ‘pinna’ (its diminutive ‘pinnaculum’,
has given us ‘pinnacle’) for that of a building.
So is it with ‘Thrax’ a Thracian, and ‘Threx’ a gladiator;
with ‘codex’ and ‘caudex’; ‘forfex’ and ‘forceps’;
‘anticus’ and ‘antiquus’; ‘celeber’ and ‘creber’; ‘infacetus’
and ‘inficetus’; ‘providentia’, ‘prudentia’,
and ‘provincia’; ‘columen’ and ‘culmen’; ‘coitus’ and

A passage from Hacket’s <i>Life of Archbishop Williams</i>,
part 2, p. 144, marks the first rise of this word, and the
quarter from whence it arose: “When they [the Presbyterians]
saw that he was not <i>selfish</i> (it is a word of their
own new mint), etc”. In Whitlock’s <i>Zootomia</i> (1654)
there is another indication of it as a novelty, p. 364:
“If constancy may be tainted with this <i>selfishness</i> (to
use our <i>new wordings</i> of old and general actings)”&mdash;It
is he who in his striking essay, <i>The Grand Schismatic, or
Suist Anatomized</i>, puts forward his own words, ‘suist’,
and ‘suicism’, in lieu of those which have ultimately been
adopted. ‘Suicism’, let me observe, had not in his time
the obvious objection of resembling another word
nearly, and being liable to be confused with it; for ‘suicide’
did not then exist in the language, nor indeed till
some twenty years later. The coming up of ‘suicide’ is
marked by this passage in Phillips’ <i>New World of Words</i>,
1671, 3rd ed.: “Nor less to be exploded is the word
‘<i>suicide</i>’, which may as well seem to participate of <i>sus</i>
a sow, as of the pronoun <i>sui</i>”. In the <i>Index</i> to Jackson’s
Works, published two years later, it is still ‘<i>suicidium</i>’&mdash;“the
horrid <i>suicidium</i> of the Jews at York”.
‘Suicide’ is apparently of much later introduction into
French. Génin (<i>Récréations Philol.</i> vol. i, p. 194) places
it about the year 1728, and makes the Abbé Desfontaines
its first sponsor. He is wrong, as the words just quoted
show, in supposing that we borrowed it from the French,
or that the word did not exist in English till the middle
of last century. The French sometimes complain that
the fashion of suicide was borrowed from England. It
would seem at all events probable that the word was so
borrowed.</p>

<p>Let me urge here the advantage of a complete collection,
or one as nearly complete as the industry of the collectors
would allow, of all the notices in our literature, which
mark, and would serve as dates for, the first incoming
of new words into the language. These notices are of
the most various kinds. Sometimes they are protests
and remonstrances, as that just quoted, against a new
word’s introduction; sometimes they are gratulations
at the same; while many hold themselves neuter as to
approval or disapproval, and merely state, or allow us to
gather, the fact of a word’s recent appearance. There
are not a few of these notices in Richardson’s <i>Dictionary</i>:
thus one from Lord Bacon under ‘essay’; from Swift
under ‘banter’; from Sir Thomas Elyot under ‘mansuetude’;
from Lord Chesterfield under ‘flirtation’;
from Davies and Marlowe’s <i>Epigrams</i> under ‘gull’; from
Roger North under ‘sham’ (Appendix); the third quotation
from Dryden under ‘mob’; one from the same under
‘philanthropy’, and again under ‘witticism’, in which
he claims the authorship of the word; that from Evelyn
under ‘miss’; and from Milton under ‘demagogue’.
There are also notices of the same kind in <i>Todd’s Johnson</i>.
The work, however, is one which no single scholar could
hope to accomplish, which could only be accomplished
by many lovers of their native tongue throwing into a
common stock the results of their several studies. The
sources from which these illustrative passages might
be gathered cannot beforehand be enumerated, inasmuch
as it is difficult to say in what unexpected quarter they
would not sometimes be found, although some of these
sources are obvious enough. As a very slight sample
of what might be done in this way by the joint contributions
of many, let me throw together references to a few
passages of the kind which I do not think have found
their way into any of our dictionaries. Thus add to that
which Richardson has quoted on ‘banter’, another from
<i>The Tatler</i>, No. 230. On ‘plunder’ there are two instructive
passages in Fuller’s <i>Church History</i>, b. xi, §&nbsp;4, 33;
and b. ix, §&nbsp;4; and one in Heylin’s <i>Animadversions</i> thereupon,
p. 196. On ‘admiralty’ see a note in Harington’s
<i>Ariosto</i>, book 19; on ‘maturity’ Sir Thomas Elyot’s
<i>Governor</i>, b. i, c. 22; and on ‘industry’ the same, b. i,
c. 23; on ‘neophyte’ a notice in Fulke’s <i>Defence of the
English Bible</i>, Parker Society’s edition, p. 586; and on
‘panorama’, and marking its recent introduction (it is
not in Johnson), a passage in Pegge’s <i>Anecdotes of the
English Language</i>, first published in 1803, but my reference
is to the edition of 1814, p. 306; on ‘accommodate’,
and supplying a date for its first coming into popular
use, see Shakespeare’s <i>2 Henry IV.</i> Act 3, Sc. 2; on
‘shrub’, Junius’ <i>Etymologicon</i>, s. v. ‘syrup’; on ‘sentiment’
and ‘cajole’ Skinner, s. vv., in his <i>Etymologicon</i>
(‘vox nuper civitate donata’); and on ‘opera’ Evelyn’s
<i>Memoirs and Diary</i>, 1827, vol. i, pp. 189, 190. In such
a collection should be included those passages of our
literature which supply implicit evidence for the non-existence
of a word up to a certain moment. It may be
urged that it is difficult, nay impossible, to prove a negative;
and yet a passage like this from Bolingbroke makes
certain that when it was written the word ‘isolated’ did
not exist in our language: “The events we are witnesses
of in the course of the longest life, appear to us very often
original, unprepared, signal and <i>unrelative</i>: if I may use
such a word for want of a better in English. In French
I would say <i>isolés</i>” (<i>Notes and Queries</i>, No. 226). Compare
Lord Chesterfield in a letter to Bishop Chenevix,
of date March 12, 1767: “I have survived almost all
my cotemporaries, and as I am too old to make new
acquaintances, I find myself <i>isolé</i>”. So, too, it is pretty
certain that ‘amphibious’ was not yet English, when one
writes (in 1618): “We are like those creatures called
<ins class="correction" title="Greek: amphibia;
original reads ‘ἀμφιβια’">ἀμφίβια</ins>, who live in
water or on land”. <span title="Greek: Zôologia">Ζωολογία</span>, the
title of a book published in 1649, makes it clear that
‘zoology’ was not yet in our vocabulary, as
<span title="Greek: zôophyton">ζωόφυτον</span> (Jackson)
proves the same for ‘zoophyte’, and
<ins class="correction" title="Greek: polytheismos;
original reads ‘πολυθεισμος’">πολυθεϊσμος</ins> (Gell)
for ‘polytheism’. One precaution, let me observe,
would be necessary in the collecting, or rather in the
adopting of any statements about the newness of a word&mdash;for
the passages themselves, even when erroneous, ought
not the less to be noted&mdash;namely, that, where there is
the least motive for suspicion, no one’s affirmation ought
to be accepted simply and at once as to the novelty of a
word; for all here are liable to error. Thus more than
one which Sir Thomas Elyot indicates as new in his time,
‘magnanimity’ for example (<i>The Governor</i>, 2, 14), are to
be met in Chaucer. When Skinner affirmed of ‘sentiment’
that it had only recently obtained the rights of
English citizenship from the translators of French books,
he was altogether mistaken, this word being also one of
continual recurrence in Chaucer. An intelligent correspondent
gives in <i>Notes and Queries</i>, No. 225, a useful
catalogue of recent neologies in our speech, which yet
would require to be used with caution, for there are at least
half a dozen in the list which have not the smallest right
to be so considered.</p></div>

<h2><a name="III" id="III"></a>III</h2>

<h3>DIMINUTIONS OF THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE</h3>


<p>I took occasion to observe at the commencement
of my last lecture that it is the essential
character of a living language to be in flux<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> and
flow, to be gaining and losing; the words which
constitute it as little continuing exactly the same,
or in the same relations to one another, as do
the atoms which at any one moment make up our
bodies remain for ever without subtraction or addition.
As I then undertook for my especial
subject to trace some of the acquisitions which our
own language had made, I shall consider in the
present some of the losses, or at any rate diminutions,
which during the same period it has endured.
But it will be well here, by one or two remarks
going before, to avert any possible misapprehensions
of my meaning.</p>

<p>It is certain that all languages must, or at least
all languages do in the end, perish. They run their
course; not at all at the same rate, for the tendency
to change is different in different languages, both
from internal causes (mechanism and the like), and
also from causes external to the language, laid in
the varying velocities of social progress and social
decline; but so it is, that whether of shorter or
longer life, they have their youth, their manhood,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
their old age, their decrepitude, their final dissolution.
Not indeed that, even when this last hour
has arrived, they disappear, leaving no traces behind
them. On the contrary, out of their death
a new life comes forth; they pass into new forms,
the materials of which they were composed more
or less survive, but these now organized in new
shapes and according to other laws of life. Thus
for example, the Latin perishes as a living language,
but a chief part of the words that composed
it live on in the four daughter languages, French,
Italian, Spanish, Portuguese; or the six, if we
count the Provençal and Wallachian; not a few
in our own. Still in their own proper being languages
perish and pass away; there are dead
records of what they were in books; not living
men who speak them any more. Seeing then
that they thus die, they must have had the germs
of a possible decay and death in them from the
beginning.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Languages Gain and Lose</i></div>

<p>Nor is this all; but in such mighty strong built
fabrics as these, the causes which thus bring about
their final dissolution must have been actually at
work very long before the results began to be
visible. Indeed, very often it is with them as
with states, which, while in some respects they
are knitting and strengthening, in others are
already unfolding the seeds of their future and, it
may be, still remote overthrow. Equally in these
and those, in states and in languages, it would be a
serious mistake to assume that all up to a certain
point and period is growth and gain, while all after
is decay and loss. On the contrary, there are long
periods during which growth in some directions is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
going hand in hand with decay in others; losses
in one kind are being compensated, or more than
compensated, by gains in another; during which
a language changes, but only as the bud changes
into the flower, and the flower into the fruit. A
time indeed arrives when the growth and gains,
becoming ever fewer, cease to constitute any
longer a compensation for the losses and the
decay; which are ever becoming more; when the
forces of disorganization and death at work are
stronger than those of life and order. It is from
this moment the decline of a language may properly
be dated. But until that crisis and turning
point has arrived, we may be quite justified in
speaking of the losses of a language, and may
esteem them most real, without in the least thereby
implying that the period of its commencing degeneracy
has begun. This may yet be far distant,
and therefore when I dwell on certain losses and
diminutions which our own has undergone, or is
undergoing, you will not conclude that I am seeking
to present it to you as now travelling the
downward course to dissolution and death. This
is very far from my intention. If in some respects
it is losing, in others it is gaining. Nor is everything
which it lets go, a loss; for this too, the
parting with a word in which there is no true
help, the dropping of a cumbrous or superfluous
form, may itself be sometimes a most real gain.
English is undoubtedly becoming different from
what it has been; but only different in that it is
passing into another stage of its development;
only different, as the fruit is different from the
flower, and the flower from the bud; having<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
changed its merits, but not having renounced
them; possessing, it may be, less of beauty, but
more of usefulness; not, perhaps, serving the poet
so well, but serving the historian and philosopher
and theologian better than before.</p>

<p>One observation more let me make, before entering
on the special details of my subject. It is
this. The losses and diminutions of a language differ
in one respect from its gains and acquisitions&mdash;namely,
that they are of <i>two</i> kinds, while its gains
are only of <i>one</i>. Its gains are only in <i>words</i>; it
never puts forth in the course of its evolution
a new <i>power</i>; it never makes for itself a new case,
or a new tense, or a new comparative. But its
losses are both in words and in <i>powers</i>&mdash;in words
of course, but in powers also: it leaves behind it,
as it travels onwards, cases which it once possessed;
renounces the employment of tenses which it once
used; forgets its dual; is content with one termination
both for masculine and feminine, and so
on. Nor is this a peculiar feature of one language,
but the universal law of all. “In all languages”,
as has been well said, “there is a constant
tendency to relieve themselves of that precision
which chooses a fresh symbol for every shade of
meaning, to lessen the amount of nice distinction,
and detect as it were a royal road to the interchange
of opinion”. For example, a vast number
of languages had at an early period of their development,
besides the singular and plural, a dual number,
some even a trinal, which they have let go at
a later. But what I mean by a language renouncing
its powers will, I trust, be more clear to you
before my lecture is concluded. This much<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
I have here said on the matter, to explain and justify
a division which I shall make, considering first
the losses of the English language in <i>words</i>, and
then in <i>powers</i>.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Words become Extinct</i></div>

<p>And first, there is going forward a continual
extinction of the words in our language&mdash;as indeed
in every other. When I speak of this, the dying
out of words, I do not refer to mere <i>tentative</i>,
experimental words, not a few of which I adduced
in my last lecture, words offered to the language,
but not accepted by it; I refer rather to such as
either belonged to the primitive stock of the language,
or if not so, which had been domiciled
in it long, that they might have been supposed to
have found in it a lasting home. Thus not a few
pure Anglo-Saxon words which lived on into the
times of our early English, have subsequently
dropped out of our vocabulary, sometimes leaving
a gap which has never since been filled, but their
places oftener taken by others which have come up
in their room. Not to mention those of Chaucer
and Wiclif, which are very numerous, many held
their ground to far later periods, and yet have
finally given way. That beautiful word ‘wanhope’
for despair, hope which has so <i>waned</i> that now
there is an entire <i>want</i> of it, was in use down to
the reign of Elizabeth; it occurs so late as in the
poems of Gascoigne<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a>.
‘Skinker’ for
cupbearer,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
(an ungraceful word, no doubt) is used by Shakespeare
and lasted till Dryden’s time and beyond.</p>

<p>Spenser uses often ‘to welk’ (welken) in the sense
of to fade, ‘to sty’ for to mount, ‘to hery’ as to
glorify or praise, ‘to halse’ as to embrace, ‘teene’
as vexation or grief: Shakespeare ‘to tarre’ as to
provoke, ‘to sperr’ as to enclose or bar in; ‘to
sag’ for to droop, or hang the head downward.
Holland employs ‘geir’<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> for vulture (“vultures or
<i>geirs</i>”), ‘specht’ for woodpecker, ‘reise’ for journey,
‘frimm’ for lusty or strong. ‘To schimmer’
occurs in Bishop Hall; ‘to tind’, that is, to kindle,
and surviving in ‘tinder’, is used by Bishop Sanderson;
‘to nimm’, or take, as late as by Fuller.
A rogue is a ‘skellum’ in Sir Thomas Urquhart.
‘Nesh’ in the sense of soft through moisture, ‘leer’
in that of empty, ‘eame’ in that of uncle, <i>mother’s</i>
brother (the German ‘oheim’), good Saxon-English
once, still live on in some of our provincial
dialects; so <ins class="correction" title="original reads ‘dose’">does</ins>
‘flitter-mouse’ or ‘flutter-mouse’
(mus volitans), where we should use bat. Indeed
of those above named several do the same; it is
so with ‘frimm’, with ‘to sag’, ‘to nimm’.
‘Heft’ employed by Shakespeare in the sense of
weight, is still employed in the same sense by our
peasants in Hampshire<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Vigorous Compound Words</i></div>

<p>A number of vigorous compounds we have
dropped and let go. ‘Earsports’ for entertainments
of song or music (<span title="Greek: akroamata">ἀκροάματα</span>) is a constantly
recurring word in Holland’s <i>Plutarch</i>.
Were it not for Shakespeare, we should have quite
forgotten that young men of hasty fiery valour
were called ‘hotspurs’; and even now we regard
the word rather as the proper name of one than
that which would have been once alike the designation
of all<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a>. Fuller warns men that they should
not ‘witwanton’ with God. Severe austere old
men, such as, in Falstaff’s words would “hate us
youth”, were ‘grimsirs’, or ‘grimsires’ once (Massinger).
‘Realmrape’ (=&nbsp;usurpation), occurring
in <i>The Mirror for Magistrates</i>, is a vigorous
word. ‘Rootfast’ and ‘rootfastness’<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> were ill
lost, being worthy to have lived; so too was Lord
Brooke’s ‘bookhunger’; and Baxter’s ‘word-warriors’,
with which term he noted those whose
strife was only about words. ‘Malingerer’ is
familiar enough to military men, but I do not find
it in our dictionaries; being the soldier who, out
of <i>evil will</i> (malin gré) to his work, shams and
shirks and is not found in the ranks<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a>.</p>

<p>Those who would gladly have seen the Anglo-Saxon
to have predominated over the Latin ele<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>ment
in our language, even more than it actually has
done, must note with regret that in many instances
a word of the former stock had been dropped, and
a Latin coined to supply its place; or where the
two once existed side by side, the Saxon has died,
and the Latin lived on. Thus Wiclif employed
‘soothsaw’, where we now use proverb; ‘sourdough’,
where we employ leaven; ‘wellwillingness’
for benevolence; ‘againbuying’ for redemption;
‘againrising’ for resurrection; ‘undeadliness’ for
immortality; ‘uncunningness’ for ignorance;
‘aftercomer’ for descendant; ‘greatdoingly’ for
magnificently; ‘to afterthink’ (still in use in Lancashire)
for to repent; ‘medeful’, which has given
way to meritorious; ‘untellable’ for ineffable;
‘dearworth’ for precious; Chaucer has ‘forword’
for promise; Sir John Cheke ‘freshman’ for proselyte;
‘mooned’ for lunatic; ‘foreshewer’ for prophet;
‘hundreder’ for centurion; Jewel ‘foretalk’,
where we now employ preface; Holland ‘sunstead’
where we use solstice; ‘leechcraft’ instead
of medicine; and another, ‘wordcraft’ for logic;
‘starconner’ (Gascoigne) did service once, if not
instead of astrologer, yet side by side with it;
‘halfgod’ (Golding) had the advantage over ‘demigod’,
that it was all of one piece; ‘to eyebite’
(Holland) told its story at least as well as to
fascinate; ‘shriftfather’ as confessor; ‘earshrift’
(Cartwright) is only two syllables, while ‘auricular
confession’ is eight; ‘waterfright’ is a better word
than our awkward Greek hydrophobia. The lamprey
(lambens petram) was called once the ‘suckstone’
or the ‘lickstone’; and the anemone the
‘windflower’. ‘Umstroke’, if it had lived on (it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
appears as late as Fuller, though our dictionaries
know nothing of it), might have made ‘circumference’
and ‘periphery’ unnecessary. ‘Wanhope’,
as we saw just now, has given place to despair,
‘middler’ to mediator; and it would be easy to
increase this list.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Local and Provincial English</i></div>

<p>I had occasion just now to notice the fact that
many words survive in our provincial dialects,
long after they have died out from the main body
of the speech. The fact is one connected with so
much of deep interest in the history of language
that I cannot pass it thus slightly over. It is one
which, rightly regarded, may assist to put us in a
just point of view for estimating the character of
the local and provincial in speech, and rescuing it
from that unmerited contempt and neglect with
which it is often regarded. I must here go somewhat
further back than I could wish; but only so,
only by looking at the matter in connexion with
other phenomena of speech, can I hope to explain
to you the worth and significance which local and
provincial words and usages must oftentimes
possess.</p>

<p>Let us then first suppose a portion of those
speaking a language to have been separated off
from the main body of its speakers, either through
their forsaking for one cause or other of their
native seats, or by the intrusion of a hostile people,
like a wedge, between them and the others, forcibly
keeping them asunder, and cutting off their
communications one with the other, as the Saxons
intruded between the Britons of Cornwall and of
Wales. In such a case it will inevitably happen
that before very long differences of speech will<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
begin to reveal themselves between those to whom
even dialectic distinctions may have been once
unknown. The divergences will be of various
kinds. Idioms will come up in the separated body,
which, not being recognized and allowed by those
who remain the arbiters of the language, will be
esteemed by them, should they come under their
notice, violations of its law, or at any rate departures
from its purity. Again, where a colony has
gone forth into new seats, and exists under new
conditions, it is probable that the necessities, physical
and moral, rising out of these new conditions,
will give birth to words, which there will be nothing
to call out among those who continue in the old
haunts of the nation. Intercourse with new tribes
and people will bring in new words, as, for instance,
contact with the Indian tribes of North
America has given to American English a certain
number of words hardly or not at all allowed or
known by us; or as the presence of a large Dutch
population at the Cape has given to the English
spoken there many words, as ‘inspan’, ‘outspan’<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a>,
‘spoor’, of which our home English knows nothing.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Antiquated English</i></div>

<p>There is another cause, however, which will probably
be more effectual than all these, namely,
that words will in process of time be dropped by
those who constitute the original stock of the
nation, which will not be dropped by the offshoot;
idioms which those have overlived, and have stored
up in the unhonoured lumber-room of the past, will
still be in use and currency among the smaller and
separated section which has gone forth; and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
thus it will come to pass that what seems and in
fact is the newer swarm, will have many older
words, and very often an archaic air and old-world
fashion both about the words they use, their
way of pronouncing, their order and manner of
combining them. Thus after the Conquest we
know that our insular French gradually diverged
from the French of the Continent. The Prioress
in Chaucer’s <i>Canterbury Tales</i> could speak her
French “full faire and fetishly”, but it was French,
as the poet slyly adds,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“After the scole of Stratford atte bow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For French of Paris was to hire unknowe”.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>One of our old chroniclers, writing in the reign of
Elizabeth, informs us that by the English colonists
within the Pale in Ireland numerous words were
preserved in common use, “the dregs of the old
ancient Chaucer English”, as he contemptuously
calls it, which had become quite obsolete and forgotten
in England itself. For example, they still
called a spider an ‘attercop’&mdash;a word, by the way,
still in popular use in the North;&mdash;a physician a
‘leech’, as in poetry he still is called; a dunghill
was still for them a ‘mixen’; (the word is still
common all over England in this sense;) a quadrangle
or base court was a ‘bawn’<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a>;
they em<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>ployed
‘uncouth’ in the earlier sense of unknown.
Nay more, their general manner of speech was so
different, though containing English still, that
Englishmen at their first coming over often found
it hard or impossible to comprehend. We have
another example of the same in what took place
after the revocation of the Edict of Nantes, and
the consequent formation of colonies of Protestant
French emigrants in various places, especially in
Amsterdam and other chief cities of Holland.
There gradually grew up among these what came to
be called ‘refugee French’, which within a generation
or two diverged in several particulars from
the classical language of France; its divergence
being mainly occasioned by this, that it remained
stationary, while the classical language was in
motion; it retained usages and words, which the
latter had dismissed<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Provincial English</i></div>

<p>Nor is it otherwise in respect of our English
provincialisms. It is true that our country people
who in the main employ them, have not been
separated by distance of space, nor yet by insurmountable
obstacles intervening, from the main
body of their fellow-countrymen; but they have
been quite as effectually divided by deficient
education. They have been, if not locally, yet
intellectually, kept at a distance from the onward
march of the nation’s mind; and of them also it
is true that many of their words, idioms, turns
of speech, which we are ready to set down as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
vulgarisms, solecisms of speech, violations of the
primary rules of grammar, do merely attest that
those who employ them have not kept abreast
with the advance of the language and nation, but
have been left behind by it. The usages are only
local in the fact that, having once been employed
by the whole body of the English people, they
have now receded from the lips of all except those
in some certain country districts, who have been
more faithful than others to the tradition of the
past<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a>.</p>

<p>It is thus in respect of a multitude of isolated
words, which were excellent Anglo-Saxon, which
were excellent early English, and which only are
not excellent present English, because use, which
is the supreme arbiter in these matters, has
decided against their further employment.
Several of these I enumerated just now. It is
thus also with several grammatical forms and
flexions. For instance, where we decline the plural
of “I sing”, “we sing”, “ye sing”, “they sing”,
there are parts of England in which they would
decline, “we sin<i>gen</i>”, “ye sin<i>gen</i>”, “they sin<i>gen</i>”.
This is not indeed the original form of the plural,
but it is that form of it which, coming up about
Chaucer’s time, was just going out in Spenser’s;
he, though we must ever keep in mind
that he does not fairly represent the language of
his time, or indeed of any time, affecting a certain
artificial archaism both in words and forms,
con<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>tinually
uses it<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a>.
After him it becomes ever
rarer, the last of whom I am aware as occasionally
using it being Fuller, until it quite disappears.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Earlier and Later English</i></div>

<p>Of such as may now employ forms like these
we must say, not that they violate the laws of the
language, but only that they have taken their
<i>permanent</i> stand at a point which was only a
point of transition, and which it has now left behind,
and overlived. Thus, to take examples which
you may hear at the present day in almost any part
of England&mdash;a countryman will say, “He made
me <i>afeard</i>”; or “The price of corn <i>ris</i> last
market day”; or “I will <i>axe</i> him his name”; or
“I tell <i>ye</i>”. You would probably set these phrases
down for barbarous English. They are not so at
all; in one sense they are quite as good English
as “He made me <i>afraid</i>”; or “The price of corn
<i>rose</i> last market day”; or “I will <i>ask</i> him his
name”. ‘Afeard’, used by Spenser, is the regular<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
participle of the old verb to ‘affear’, still existing
as a law term, as ‘afraid’ is of to ‘affray’, and
just as good English<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a>; ‘ris’ or ‘risse’ is an old
<ins class="correction" title="original reads ‘preterite’">præterite</ins>
of ‘to rise’; to ‘axe’ is not a mispronunciation
of ‘to ask’, but a genuine English form
of the word, the form which in the earlier English
it constantly assumed; in Wiclif’s Bible almost
without exception; and indeed ‘axe’ occurs continually,
I know not whether invariably, in Tyndale’s
translation of the Scriptures; there was
a time when ‘ye’ was an accusative, and to have
used it as a nominative or vocative, the only permitted
uses at present, would have been incorrect.
Even such phrases as “Put <i>them</i> things away”; or
“The man <i>what</i> owns the horse” are not bad,
but only antiquated English<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a>. Saying this, I
would not in the least imply that these forms are
open to you to employ, or that they would be good
English for <i>you</i>. They would not; inasmuch as
they are contrary to present use and custom, and
these must be our standards in what we speak, and
in what we write; just as in our buying and selling
we are bound to employ the current coin of
the realm, must not attempt to pass that which
long since has been called in, whatever merits
or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
<ins class="correction" title="original reads ‘instrinsic’">intrinsic</ins>
value it may possess. All which I
affirm is that the phrases just brought forward
represent past stages of the language, and are not
barbarous violations of it.</p>

<p>The same may be asserted of certain ways of
pronouncing words, which are now in use among
the lower classes, but not among the higher; as,
for example, ‘contrāry’, ‘mischiēvous’, ‘blasphēmous’,
instead of ‘contrăry’, ‘mischiĕvous’, ‘blasphĕmous’.
It would be abundantly easy to show
by a multitude of quotations from our poets, and
those reaching very far down, that these are merely
the retention of the earlier pronunciation by the
people, after the higher classes have abandoned
it<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a>.
And on the strength of what has just been spoken,
let me here suggest to you how well worth your
while it will prove to be on the watch for provincial
words and inflexions, local idioms and
modes of pronunciation, and to take note of these.
Count nothing in this kind beneath your notice.

<span class="sidenote"><i>Luncheon</i>, <i>Nuncheon</i></span>

Do not at once ascribe anything which you hear
to the ignorance or stupidity of the speaker. Thus
if you hear ‘nuncheon’, do not at once set it
down for a malformation of
‘luncheon’<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a>,
nor<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
‘yeel’<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a>,
of ‘eel’. Lists and collections of provincial
usage, such as I have suggested, always have their
value. If you are not able to turn them to any
profit yourselves, and they may not stand in close
enough connexion with your own studies for this,
yet there always are those who will thank you for
them; and to whom the humblest of these collec<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>tions,
carefully and intelligently made, will be in
one way or another of real assistance<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a>. And there
is the more need to urge this at the present,
because, notwithstanding the tenacity with which
our country folk cling to their old forms and
usages, still these forms and usages must now be
rapidly growing fewer; and there are forces, moral
and material, at work in England, which will
probably cause that of those which now survive
the greater part will within the next fifty years have
disappeared<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>‘Its’ of Late Introduction</i></div>

<p>Before quitting this subject, let me instance one
example more of that which is commonly accounted
ungrammatical usage, but which is really the retention
of old grammar by some, where others
have substituted new; I mean the constant application
by our rustic population in the south, and
I dare say through all parts of England, of ‘his’ to
inanimate objects, and to these not personified, no
less than to persons; where ‘its’ would be employed
by others. This was once the manner of speech
among all; for ‘its’ is a word of very recent
introduction, many would be surprised to learn
of how recent introduction, into the language.
You will look for it in vain through the whole<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
of our Authorized Version of the Bible; the office
which it now fulfils being there accomplished, as
our rustics accomplish it at the present, by ‘his’
(Gen. i. 11; Exod. xxxvii. 17; Matt. v. 15) or
‘her’ (Jon. i. 15; Rev. xxii. 2) applied as freely
to inanimate things as to persons, or else by
‘thereof’ (Ps. lxv. 10) or ‘of it’ (Dan. vii. 5). Nor
may Lev. xx. 5 be urged as invalidating this assertion;
for reference to the exemplar edition of 1611,
or indeed to any earlier editions of King James’
Bible, will show that in them the passage stood,
“of <i>it</i> own accord”<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a>. ‘Its’ occurs very rarely
in Shakespeare, in many of his plays it will not
once be found. Milton also for the most part
avoids it, and this, though in his time others freely
allowed it. How soon all this was forgotten we
have striking evidence in the fact that when
Dryden, in one of his fault-finding moods with
the great men of the preceding generation, is
taking Ben Jonson to task for general inaccuracy
in his English diction, among other counts of his
indictment, he quotes this line from <i>Catiline</i></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Though heaven should speak with all <i>his</i> wrath at once”,<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>and proceeds, “<i>heaven</i> is ill syntax with <i>his</i>”;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
while in fact up to within forty or fifty years of
the time when Dryden began to write, no other
syntax was known; and to a much later date was
exceedingly rare. Curious also, is it to note that
in the earnest controversy which followed on Chatterton’s
publication of the poems ascribed by him
to a monk Rowlie, who should have lived in the
fifteenth century, no one appealed to such lines
as the following,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Life and all <i>its</i> goods I scorn”,<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>as at once deciding that the poems were not of the
age which they pretended. Warton, who denied,
though with some hesitation, the antiquity of
the poems, giving many and sufficient reasons for
this denial, failed to take note of this little word;
while yet there needed no more than to point it
out, for the disposing of the whole question; the
forgery at once was betrayed.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>American English</i></div>

<p>What has been here affirmed concerning our
provincial English, namely that it is often <i>old</i>
English rather than <i>bad</i> English, may be affirmed
with equal right of many so-called Americanisms.
There are parts of America where ‘het’ is used,
or was used a few years since, as the perfect of
‘to heat’; ‘holp’ as the perfect of ‘to help’;
‘stricken’ as the participle of ‘to strike’. Again
there are the words which have become obsolete
during the last two hundred years, which have not
become obsolete there, although many of them
probably retain only a provincial existence. Thus
‘slick’, which indeed is only another form of
‘sleek’, was employed by our good writers of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
seventeenth century<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a>. Other words again, which
have remained current on both sides of the
Atlantic, have yet on our side receded from their
original use, while they have remained true to it
on the other. ‘Plunder’ is a word in point<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a>.</p>

<p>In the contemplation of facts like these it has
been sometimes asked, whether a day will ever
arrive when the language spoken on this side of
the Atlantic and on the other, will divide into two
languages, an old English and a new. We may
confidently answer, No. Doubtless, if those who
went out from us to people and subdue a new
continent, had left our shores two or three centuries
earlier than they did, when the language was
very much farther removed from that ideal after
which it was unconsciously striving, and in which,
once reached, it has in great measure acquiesced;
if they had not carried with them to their distant
homes their English Bible, and what else of
worth had been already uttered in the English
tongue; if, having once left us, the intercourse
between Old and New England had been entirely
broken off, or only rare and partial; there would
then have unfolded themselves differences between
the language spoken here and there, which in
tract of time accumulating and multiplying, might
in the end have justified the regarding of the languages
as no longer one and the same. It could<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
not have failed but that such differences should
have displayed themselves; for while there is a
law of <i>necessity</i> in the evolution of languages,
while they pursue certain courses and in certain
directions, from which they can be no more turned
aside by the will of men than one of the heavenly
bodies could be pushed from its orbit by any engines
of ours, there is a law of <i>liberty</i> no less; and this
liberty must inevitably have made itself in many
ways felt. In the political and social condition
of America, so far removed from our own, in the
many natural objects which are not the same with
those which surround us here, in efforts independently
carried out to rid the language of imperfections,
or to unfold its latent powers, even in the
different effects of soil and climate on the organs
of speech, there would have been causes enough to
have provoked in the course of time not immaterial
<ins class="correction" title="so in original">divergencies</ins> of language.</p>

<p>As it is, however, the joint operation of those
three causes referred to already, namely, that the
separation did not take place in the infancy or
youth of the language, but only in its ripe manhood,
that England and America owned a body of
literature, to which they alike looked up and appealed
as containing the authoritative standards
of the language, that the intercourse between the
one people and the other has been large and frequent,
hereafter probably to be larger and more
frequent still, has effectually wrought. It has been
strong enough so to traverse, repress, and check
all those causes which tended to divergence, that
the <i>written</i> language of educated men on both
sides of the water remains precisely the same,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
their <i>spoken</i> manifesting a few trivial differences of
idiom; while even among those classes which do
not consciously acknowledge any ideal standard of
language, there are scarcely greater differences, in
some respects far smaller, than exist between
inhabitants of different provinces in this one island
of England; and in the future we may reasonably
anticipate that these differences, so far from multiplying,
will rather diminish and disappear.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Extinct English</i></div>

<p>But I must return from this long digression.
It seems often as if an almost unaccountable
caprice presided over the fortunes of words, and
determined which should live and which die.
Thus in instances out of number a word lives on
as a verb, but has ceased to be employed as a
noun; we say ‘to embarrass’, but no longer an
‘embarrass’; ‘to revile’, but not, with Chapman
and Milton, a ‘revile’; ‘to dispose’, but not a
‘dispose’<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a>; ‘to retire’ but not a ‘retire’; ‘to
wed’, but not a ‘wed’; we say ‘to infest’, but use
no longer the adjective ‘infest’. Or with a reversed
fortune a word lives on as a noun, but has perished
as a verb&mdash;thus as a noun substantive, a ‘slug’,
but no longer ‘to slug’ or render slothful; a
‘child’, but no longer ‘to child’, (“<i>childing</i>
autumn”, Shakespeare); a ‘rape’, but not ‘to
rape’ (South); a ‘rogue’, but not ‘to rogue’;
‘malice’, but not ‘to malice’; a ‘path’, but not
‘to path’; or as a noun adjective, ‘serene’, but
not ‘to serene’, a beautiful word, which we have
let go, as the French have ‘sereiner’<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a>; ‘meek’,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>but not ‘to meek’ (Wiclif); ‘fond’, but not ‘to
fond’ (Dryden); ‘dead’, but not ‘to dead’; ‘intricate’,
but ‘to intricate’ (Jeremy Taylor) no longer.</p>

<p>Or again, the affirmative remains, but the negative
is gone; thus ‘wisdom’, ‘bold’, ‘sad’, but
not any more ‘unwisdom’, ‘unbold’, ‘unsad’ (all
in Wiclif); ‘cunning’, but not ‘uncunning’;
‘manhood’, ‘wit’, ‘mighty’, ‘tall’, but not ‘unmanhood’,
‘unwit’, ‘unmighty’, ‘untall’ (all in
Chaucer); ‘buxom’, but not ‘unbuxom’ (Dryden);
‘hasty’, but not ‘unhasty’ (Spenser); ‘blithe’,
but not ‘unblithe’; ‘ease’, but not ‘unease’
(Hacket); ‘repentance’, but not ‘unrepentance’;
‘remission’, but not ‘irremission’ (Donne);
‘science’, but not ‘nescience’ (Glanvill)<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a>; ‘to know’,
but not ‘to unknow’ (Wiclif); ‘to give’, but not
‘to ungive’. Or once more, with a curious variation
from this, the negative survives, while the
affirmative is gone; thus ‘wieldy’ (Chaucer) survives
only in ‘unwieldy’; ‘couth’ and ‘couthly’
(both in Spenser), only in ‘uncouth’ and ‘uncouthly’;
‘rule’ (Foxe) only in ‘unruly’; ‘gainly’
(Henry More) in ‘ungainly’; these last two were
both of them serviceable words, and have been ill
lost<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a>;
‘gainly’ is indeed still common in the
West<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
Riding of Yorkshire; ‘exorable’ (Holland) and
‘evitable’ only in ‘inexorable’ and ‘inevitable’;
‘faultless’ remains, but hardly ‘faultful’ (Shakespeare).
In like manner ‘semble’ (Foxe) has, except
as a technical law term, disappeared; while
‘dissemble’ continues. So also of other pairs one
has been taken and one left; ‘height’, or ‘highth’,
as Milton better spelt it, remains, but ‘lowth’
(Becon) is gone; ‘righteousness’, or ‘rightwiseness’,
as it would once more accurately have
been written, for ‘righteous’ is a corruption of
‘rightwise’, remains, but its correspondent ‘wrongwiseness’
has been taken; ‘inroad’ continues, but
‘outroad’ (Holland) has disappeared; ‘levant’
lives, but ‘ponent’ (Holland) has died; ‘to extricate’
continues, but, as we saw just now, ‘to
intricate’ does not; ‘parricide’, but not ‘filicide’
(Holland). Again, of whole groups of words
formed on some particular scheme it may be
only a single specimen will survive. Thus ‘gainsay’,
that is, again say, survives; but ‘gainstrive’
(Foxe), ‘gainstand’, ‘gaincope’ (Golding), and
other similarly formed words exist no longer. It
is the same with ‘foolhardy’, which is but one,
though now indeed the only one remaining, of at
least five adjectives formed on the same principle;
thus ‘foollarge’, quite as expressive a word as
prodigal, occurs in Chaucer, and ‘foolhasty’, found
also in him, lived on to the time of Holland;
while ‘foolhappy’ is in Spencer; and ‘foolbold’
in Bale. ‘Steadfast’ remains, but ‘shamefast’,
‘rootfast’, ‘bedfast’ (=&nbsp;bedridden), ‘homefast’,
‘housefast’, ‘masterfast’ (Skelton), with others,
are all gone. ‘Exhort’ remains; but ‘dehort’ a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
word whose place neither ‘dissuade’ nor any other
exactly supplies, has escaped us<a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a>. We have ‘twilight’,
but ‘twibill’ = bipennis (Chapman) is
extinct.</p>

<p>Let me mention another real loss, where in like
manner there remains in the present language
something to remind us of that which is gone.
The comparative ‘rather’ stands alone, having
dropped on one side its positive ‘rathe’<a name="FNanchor_155_155" id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a>, and on the
other its superlative ‘rathest’. ‘Rathe’, having
the sense of early, though a graceful word, and not
fallen quite out of popular remembrance, inasmuch
as it is embalmed in the <i>Lycidas</i> of Milton,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“And the <i>rathe</i> primrose, which forsaken dies”,<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>might still be suffered without remark to share the
common lot of so many words which have perished,
though worthy to have lived; but the disuse
of ‘rathest’ has left a real gap in the language,
and the more so, seeing that ‘liefest’ is
gone too. ‘Rather’ expresses the Latin ‘potius’;
but ‘rathest’ being out of use, we have no word,
unless ‘soonest’ may be accepted as such, to
express ‘potissimum’, or the preference not of one
way over another or over certain others, but of
one over all; which we therefore effect by aid of
various circumlocutions. Nor has ‘rathest’ been
so long out of use, that it would be playing the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
antic to attempt to revive it. It occurs in the
<i>Sermons</i> of Bishop Sanderson, who in the opening
of that beautiful sermon from the text, “When my
father and my mother forsake me, the Lord taketh
me up”, puts the consideration, “why these”,
that is, father and mother, “are named the <i>rathest</i>,
and the rest to be included in them”<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a>.</p>

<p>It is sometimes easy enough, but indeed oftener
hard, and not seldom quite impossible, to trace
the causes which have been at work to bring about
that certain words, little by little, drop out of the
language of men, come to be heard more and more
rarely, and finally are not heard any more at all&mdash;to
trace the motives which have induced a whole
people thus to arrive at a tacit consent not to employ
them any longer; for without this tacit consent
they could never have thus become obsolete.
That it is not accident, that there is a law here at
work, however hidden it may be from us, is plain
from the fact that certain families of words, words
formed on certain patterns, have a tendency thus
to fall into desuetude.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Words in ‘-some’</i></div>

<p>Thus, I think, we may trace a tendency in words
ending in ‘some’, the Anglo-Saxon and early English
‘sum’, the German ‘sam’ (‘friedsam’, ‘seltsam’)
to fall out of use. It is true that a vast number
of these survive, as ‘gladsome’, ‘handsome’,
‘wearisome’, ‘buxom’ (this last spelt better
‘bucksome’, by our earlier writers, for its present
spelling altogether disguises its true character, and
the family to which it
<ins class="correction" title="missing ‘)’ in original">belongs);</ins> being the same
word as the German ‘beugsam’ or ‘biegsam’,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>bendable,
compliant<a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a>;
but a larger number of these
words than can be ascribed to accident, many
more than the due proportion of them, are either
quite or nearly extinct. Thus in Wiclif’s Bible
alone you might note the following, ‘lovesum’,
‘hatesum’, ‘lustsum’, ‘gilsum’ (guilesome), ‘wealsum’,
‘heavysum’, ‘lightsum’, ‘delightsum’; of
these ‘lightsome’ long survived, and indeed still
survives in provincial dialects; but of the others
all save ‘delightsome’ are gone; and that, although
used in our Authorized Version (Mal. iii, 12), is
now only employed in poetry. So too ‘mightsome’
(see Coleridge’s <i>Glossary</i>), ‘brightsome’
(Marlowe), ‘wieldsome’, and ‘unwieldsome’
(Golding), ‘unlightsome’ (Milton), ‘healthsome’
(<i>Homilies</i>), ‘ugsome’ and ‘ugglesome’ (both in
Foxe), ‘laboursome’ (Shakespeare), ‘friendsome’,
‘longsome’ (Bacon), ‘quietsome’, ‘mirksome’
(both in Spenser), ‘toothsome’ (Beaumont and
Fletcher), ‘gleesome’, ‘joysome’ (both in Browne’s
<i>Pastorals</i>), ‘gaysome’ (<i>Mirror for Magistrates</i>),
‘roomsome’, ‘bigsome’, ‘awesome’, ‘timersome’,
‘winsome’, ‘viewsome’, ‘dosome’ (=&nbsp;prosperous),
‘flaysome’ (=&nbsp;fearful), ‘auntersome’ (=&nbsp;adventurous),
‘clamorsome’ (all these still surviving in
the North), ‘playsome’ (employed by the historian
Hume), ‘lissome’<a name="FNanchor_158_158" id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a>, have nearly or quite disappeared
from our English speech. They seem to have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
held their ground in Scotland in considerably
larger numbers than in the south of the Island<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Words in ‘-ard’</i></div>

<p>Neither can I esteem it a mere accident that of
a group of depreciatory and contemptuous words
ending in ‘ard’, at least one half should have
dropped out of use; I refer to that group of
which ‘dotard’, ‘laggard’, ‘braggard’, now spelt
‘braggart’, ‘sluggard’, ‘buzzard’, ‘bastard’,
‘wizard’, may be taken as surviving specimens;
‘blinkard’ (<i>Homilies</i>), ‘dizzard’ (Burton), ‘dullard’
(Udal), ‘musard’ (Chaucer), ‘trichard’
(<i>Political Songs</i>), ‘shreward’ (Robert of Gloucester),
‘ballard’ (a bald-headed man, Wiclif);
‘puggard’, ‘stinkard’ (Ben Jonson), ‘haggard’,
a worthless hawk, as extinct.</p>

<p>Thus too there is a very curious province of our
language, in which we were once so rich, that
extensive losses here have failed to make us poor;
so many of its words still surviving, even after as
many or more have disappeared. I refer to those
double words which either contain within themselves
a strong rhyming modulation, such for example
as ‘willy-nilly’, ‘hocus-pocus’, ‘helter-skelter’,
‘tag-rag’, ‘namby-pamby’, ‘pell-mell’,
‘hodge-podge’; or with a slight difference from this,
though belonging to the same group, those of
which the characteristic feature is not this internal
likeness with initial unlikeness, but initial
likeness with internal unlikeness; not rhyming,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
but strongly alliterative, and in every case with a
change of the interior vowel from a weak into a
strong, generally from <i>i</i> into <i>a</i> or <i>o</i>; as ‘shilly-shally’,
‘mingle-mangle’, ‘tittle-tattle’, ‘prittle-prattle’,
‘riff-raff’, ‘see-saw’, ‘slip-slop’.
No one who is not quite out of love with the homelier
yet more vigorous portions of the language,
but will acknowledge the life and strength which
there is often in these and in others still current
among us. But of the same sort what vast numbers
have fallen out of use, some so fallen out of all
remembrance that it may be difficult almost to
find credence for them. Thus take of rhyming
the following: ‘hugger-mugger’, ‘hurly-burly’,
‘kicksy-wicksy’ (all in Shakespeare); ‘hibber-gibber’,
‘rusty-dusty’, ‘horrel-lorrel’, ‘slaump
paump’ (all in Gabriel Harvey), ‘royster-doyster’
(Old Play), ‘hoddy-doddy’ (Ben Jonson); while
of alliterative might be instanced these: ‘skimble-skamble’,
‘bibble-babble’ (both in Shakespeare),
‘twittle-twattle’, ‘kim-kam’ (both in Holland),
‘hab-nab’ (Lilly), ‘trim-tram’, ‘trish-trash’,
‘swish-swash’ (all in Gabriel Harvey), ‘whim-wham’
(Beaumont and Fletcher), ‘mizz-mazz’
(Locke), ‘snip-snap’ (Pope), ‘flim-flam’ (Swift),
‘tric-trac’, and others<a name="FNanchor_160_160" id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Words under Ban</i></div>

<p>Again, there was once a whole family of words
whereof the greater number are now under ban;
which seemed at one time to have been formed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
almost at pleasure, the only condition being that
the combination should be a happy one&mdash;I mean
all those singularly expressive words formed by a
combination of verb and substantive, the former
governing the latter; as ‘telltale’, ‘scapegrace’,
‘turncoat’, ‘turntail’, ‘skinflint’, ‘spendthrift’,
‘spitfire’, ‘lickspittle’, ‘daredevil’ (=&nbsp;wagehals),
‘makebate’ (=&nbsp;störenfried), ‘marplot’, ‘killjoy’.
These with a certain number of others, have held
their ground, and may be said to be still more or
less in use; but what a number more are forgotten;
and yet, though not always elegant, they
constituted a very vigorous portion of our language,
and preserved some of its most genuine
idioms<a name="FNanchor_161_161" id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a>. It could not well be otherwise; they
are almost all words of abuse, and the abusive
words of a language are always among the most
picturesque and vigorous and imaginative which
it possesses. The whole man speaks out in them,
and often the man under the influence of passion
and excitement, which always lend force and fire
to his speech. Let me remind you of a few of
them; ‘smellfeast’, if not a better, is yet a more
graphic, word than our foreign parasite; as gra<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>phic
indeed for us as <span title="Greek: trechedeipnos">τρεχέδειπνος</span>
to Greek ears;
‘clawback’ (Hackett) is a stronger, if not a more
graceful, word than flatterer or sycophant; ‘tosspot’
(Fuller), or less frequently ‘reel-pot’ (Middleton),
tells its own tale as well as drunkard; and
‘pinchpenny’ (Holland), or ‘nipfarthing’ (Drant),
as well as or better than miser. And then what
a multitude more there are in like kind; ‘spintext’,
‘lacklatin’, ‘mumblematins’, all applied
to ignorant clerics; ‘bitesheep’ (a favourite word
with Foxe) to such of these as were rather wolves
tearing, than shepherds feeding, the flock; ‘slip-string’
= pendard (Beaumont and Fletcher),
‘slip-gibbet’, ‘scapegallows’; all names given to
those who, however they might have escaped, were
justly owed to the gallows, and might still “go
upstairs to bed”.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Obsolete Compounds</i></div>

<p>How many of these words occur in Shakespeare.
The following list makes no pretence to completeness;
‘martext’, ‘carrytale’, ‘pleaseman’,
‘sneakcup’, ‘mumblenews’, ‘wantwit’, ‘lackbrain’,
‘lackbeard’, ‘lacklove’, ‘ticklebrain’,
‘cutpurse’, ‘cutthroat’, ‘crackhemp’, ‘breedbate’,
‘swinge-buckler’, ‘pickpurse’, ‘pickthank’,
‘picklock’, ‘scarecrow’, ‘breakvow’,
‘breakpromise’, ‘makepeace’&mdash;this last and ‘telltruth’
(Fuller) being the only ones in the whole
collection wherein reprobation or contempt is
not implied. Nor is the list exhausted yet; there
are further ‘dingthrift’ = prodigal (Herrick),
‘wastegood’ (Cotgrave), ‘stroygood’ (Golding),
‘wastethrift’ (Beaumont and Fletcher), ‘scapethrift’,
‘swashbuckler’ (both in Holinshed),
‘shakebuckler’, ‘rinsepitcher’ (both in Bacon),<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
‘crackrope’ (Howell), ‘waghalter’, ‘wagfeather’
(both in Cotgrave), ‘blabtale’ (Racket), ‘getnothing’
(Adams), ‘findfault’ (Florio), ‘tearthroat’
(Gayton), ‘marprelate’, ‘spitvenom’,
‘nipcheese’, ‘nipscreed’, ‘killman’ (Chapman),
‘lackland’, ‘pickquarrel’, ‘pickfaults’, ‘pickpenny’
(Henry More), ‘makefray’ (Bishop Hall),
‘make-debate’ (Richardson’s <i>Letters</i>), ‘kindlecoal’
(attise feu), ‘kindlefire’ (both in Gurnall), ‘turntippet’
(Cranmer), ‘swillbowl’ (Stubbs), ‘smell-smock’,
‘cumberwold’ (Drayton), ‘curryfavor’,
‘pinchfist’, ‘suckfist’, ‘hatepeace’ (Sylvester),
‘hategood’ (Bunyan), ‘clutchfist’, ‘sharkgull’
(both in Middleton), ‘makesport’ (Fuller), ‘hangdog’
(“Herod’s <i>hangdogs</i> in the tapestry”, Pope),
‘catchpoll’, ‘makeshift’ (used not impersonally
as now), ‘pickgoose’ (“the bookworm was never
but a <i>pickgoose</i>”)<a name="FNanchor_162_162" id="FNanchor_162_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a>,
‘killcow’ (these three last
in Gabriel Harvey), ‘rakeshame’ (Milton, prose),
with others which it will be convenient to omit.
‘Rakehell’, which used to be spelt ‘rakel’ or
‘rakle’ (Chaucer), a good English word, would be
only through an error included in this list, although
Cowper, when he writes ‘rakehell’ (“<i>rake-hell</i>
baronet”) evidently regarded it as belonging to this
group<a name="FNanchor_163_163" id="FNanchor_163_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a>.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Words become Vulgar</i></div>

<p>Perhaps one of the most frequent causes which
leads to the disuse of words is this: in some inexplicable
way there comes to be attached something
of ludicrous, or coarse, or vulgar to them,
out of a feeling of which they are no longer used
in earnest serious writing, and at the same time
fall out of the discourse of those who desire to
speak elegantly. Not indeed that this degradation
which overtakes words is in all cases inexplicable.
The unheroic character of most men’s
minds, with their consequent intolerance of that
heroic which they cannot understand, is constantly
at work, too often with success, in taking
down words of nobleness from their high pitch;
and, as the most effectual way of doing this, in
casting an air of mock-heroic about them. Thus
‘to dub’, a word resting on one of the noblest
usages of chivalry, has now something of ludicrous
about it; so too has ‘doughty’; they belong to
that serio-comic, mock-heroic diction, the multiplication
of which, as of all parodies on greatness,
and the favour with which it is received, is always
a sign of evil augury for a nation, is at present a
sign of evil augury for our own.</p>

<p>‘Pate’ in the sense of head is now comic or
ignoble; it was not so once; as is plain from its
occurrence in the Prayer Book Version of the
Psalms (Ps. vii. 17); as little was ‘noddle’, which
occurs in one of the few poetical passages in Hawes.
The same may be said of ‘sconce’, in this sense
at least; of ‘nowl’ or ‘noll’, which Wiclif uses;
of ‘slops’ for trousers (Marlowe’s <i>Lucan</i>); of
‘cocksure’ (Rogers), of ‘smug’, which once
meant no more than adorned (“the <i>smug</i> bride<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>groom”,
Shakespeare). ‘To nap’ is now a word
without dignity; while yet in Wiclif’s Bible it
is said, “Lo he schall not <i>nappe</i>, nether slepe that
kepeth Israel” (Ps. cxxi. 4). ‘To punch’, ‘to
thump’, both of which, and in serious writing, occur
in Spenser, could not now obtain the same use,
nor yet ‘to wag’, or ‘to buss’. Neither would
any one now say that at Lystra Barnabas and
Paul “rent their clothes and <i>skipped out</i> among
the people” (Acts xiv. 14), which is the language
that Wiclif employs; nor yet that “the Lord
<i>trounced</i> Sisera and all his host” as it stands in
the Bible of 1551. “A <i>sight</i> of angels”, for which
phrase see Cranmer’s Bible (Heb. xii. 22), would
be felt as a vulgarism now. We should scarcely
call now a delusion of Satan a “<i>flam</i> of the devil”
(Henry More). It is not otherwise in regard of
phrases. “Through thick and thin”, occurring
in Spenser, “cheek by jowl” in Dubartas<a name="FNanchor_164_164" id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a>, do not
now belong to serious poetry. In the glorious
ballad of <i>Chevy Chase</i>, a noble warrior whose legs
are hewn off, is described as being “in doleful
dumps”; just as, in Holland’s <i>Livy</i>, the Romans
are set forth as being “in the dumps” as a consequence
of their disastrous defeat at Cannæ. In
Golding’s <i>Ovid</i>, one fears that he will “go to pot”.
In one of the beautiful letters of John Careless,
preserved in Foxe’s <i>Martyrs</i>, a persecutor, who
expects a recantation from him, is described as
“in the wrong box”. And in the sermons of
Barrow, who certainly intended to write an elevated
style, and did not seek familiar, still less vulgar,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
expressions, we constantly meet such terms as ‘to
rate’, ‘to snub’, ‘to gull’, ‘to pudder’, ‘dumpish’,
and the like; which we may confidently
affirm were not vulgar when he used them.</p>

<p>Then too the advance of refinement causes words
to be forgone, which are felt to speak too plainly.
It is not here merely that one age has more delicate
ears than another; and that matters are
freely spoken of at one time which at another
are withdrawn from conversation. This is something;
but besides this, and even if this delicacy
were at a standstill, there would still be a continual
process going on, by which the words,
which for a certain while have been employed to
designate coarse or disagreeable facts or things,
would be disallowed, or at all events relinquished
to the lower class of society, and others adopted in
their place. The former by long use being felt
to have come into too direct and close relation
with that which they designate, to summon it up
too distinctly before the mind’s eye, they are
thereupon exchanged for others, which, at first at
least, indicate more lightly and allusively the
offensive thing, rather hint and suggest than paint
and describe it: although by and by these new
will also in their turn be discarded, and for exactly
the same reasons which brought about the dismissal
of those which they themselves superseded.
It lies in the necessity of things that I must leave
this part of my subject, very curious as it is, without
illustration<a name="FNanchor_165_165" id="FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a>.
But no one, even moderately<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
acquainted with the early literature of the Reformation,
can be ignorant of words freely used in it,
which now are not merely coarse and as such
under ban, but which no one would employ who
did not mean to speak impurely and vilely.</p>

<hr class="small" />

<div class="sidenote"><i>Lost Powers of a Language</i></div>

<p>Thus much in respect of the words, and the
character of the words, which we have lost or let
go. Of these, indeed, if a language, as it travels
onwards, loses some, it also acquires others, and
probably many more than it loses; they are leaves
on the tree of language, of which if some fall
away, a new succession takes their place. But
it is not so, as I already observed, with the <i>forms</i>
or <i>powers</i> of a language, that is, with the various
inflections, moods, duplicate or triplicate formation
of tenses; which the speakers of a language come
gradually to perceive that they can do without,
and therefore cease to employ; seeking to suppress
grammatical intricacies, and to obtain grammatical
simplicity and so far as possible a pervading
uniformity, sometimes even at the hazard of letting
go what had real worth, and contributed to the
more lively, if not to the clearer, setting forth of
the inner thought or feeling of the mind. Here
there is only loss, with no compensating gain; or,
at all events, diminution only, and never addition.
In regard of these inner forces and potencies of a
language, there is no creative energy at work in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
its later periods, in any, indeed, but quite the
earliest. They are not as the leaves, but may be
likened to the stem and leading branches of a
tree, whose shape, mould and direction are determined
at a very early stage of its growth; and
which age, or accident, or violence may diminish,
but which can never be multiplied. I have already
slightly referred to a notable example of this,
namely, to the dropping of the dual number in the
Greek language. Thus in all the New Testament
it does not once occur, having quite fallen out of
the common dialect in which that is composed.
Elsewhere too it has been felt that the dual was
not worth preserving, or at any rate, that no
serious inconvenience would follow on its loss.
There is no such number in the modern German,
Danish or Swedish; in the old German and Norse
there was.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Extinction of Powers</i></div>

<p>How many niceties, delicacies, subtleties of
language, <i>we</i>, speakers of the English tongue,
in the course of centuries have got rid of; how
bare (whether too bare is another question) we
have stripped ourselves; what simplicity for
better or for worse reigns in the present English,
as compared with the old Anglo-Saxon. That
had six declensions, our present English but one;
that had three genders, English, if we except
one or two words, has none; that formed the
genitive in a variety of ways, we only in one;
and the same fact meets us, wherever we compare
the grammars of the two languages. At the
same time, it can scarcely be repeated too often,
that in the estimate of the gain or loss thereupon
ensuing, we must by no means put certainly to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
loss everything which the language has dismissed,
any more than everything to gain which it has
acquired. It is no real wealth in a language to
have needless and superfluous forms. They are
often an embarrassment and an encumbrance
to it rather than a help. The Finnish language
has fourteen cases. Without pretending to know
exactly what it is able to effect, I yet feel confident
that it cannot effect more, nor indeed so much,
with its fourteen as the Greek is able to do with
its five. It therefore seems to me that some
words of Otfried Müller, in many ways admirable,
do yet exaggerate the losses consequent on the
reduction of the forms of a language. “It may
be observed”, he says, “that in the lapse of ages,
from the time that the progress of language can
be observed, grammatical forms, such as the
signs of cases, moods and tenses have never been
increased in number, but have been constantly
diminishing. The history of the Romance, as
well as of the Germanic, languages shows in the
clearest manner how a grammar, once powerful
and copious, has been gradually weakened and
impoverished, until at last it preserves only a
few fragments of its ancient inflections. Now
there is no doubt that this luxuriance of grammatical
forms is not an essential part of a language,
considered merely as a vehicle of thought. It
is well known that the Chinese language, which
is merely a collection of radical words destitute
of grammatical forms, can express even philosophical
ideas with tolerable precision; and the
English, which, from the mode of its formation
by a mixture of different tongues, has been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
stripped of its grammatical inflections more
completely than any other European language,
seems, nevertheless, even to a foreigner, to be
distinguished by its energetic eloquence. All
this must be admitted by every unprejudiced
inquirer; but yet it cannot be overlooked, that
this copiousness of grammatical forms, and the
fine shades of meaning which they express, evince
a nicety of observation, and a faculty of distinguishing,
which unquestionably prove that the
race of mankind among whom these languages
arose was characterized by a remarkable correctness
and subtlety of thought. Nor can any
modern European, who forms in his mind a lively
image of the classical languages in their ancient
grammatical luxuriance, and compares them
with his mother tongue, conceal from himself
that in the ancient languages the words, with
their inflections, clothed as it were with muscles
and sinews, come forward like living bodies,
full of expression and character, while in the
modern tongues the words seem shrunk up into
mere skeletons”<a name="FNanchor_166_166" id="FNanchor_166_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Words in ‘-ess’</i></div>

<p>Whether languages are as much impoverished
by this process as is here assumed, may, I think,
be a question. I will endeavour to give you
some materials which shall assist you in forming
your own judgment in the matter. And here
I am sure that I shall do best in considering not
forms which the language has relinquished long
ago, but mainly such as it is relinquishing now;
which, touching us more nearly, will have a
far more lively interest for us all. For example,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
the female termination which we employ in certain
words, such as from ‘heir’ ‘heiress’, from
‘prophet’ ‘prophetess’, from ‘sorcerer’ ‘sorceress’,
was once far more widely extended than
at present; the words which retain it are daily
becoming fewer. It has already fallen away in
so many, and is evidently becoming of less frequent
use in so many others, that, if we may augur of
the future from the analogy of the past, it will
one day altogether vanish from our tongue.
Thus all these occur in Wiclif’s Bible; ‘techeress’
as the female teacher (2 Chron. xxxv. 25);
‘friendess’ (Prov. vii. 4); ‘servantess’ (Gen.
xvi. 2); ‘leperess’ (=&nbsp;saltatrix, Ecclus. ix.
4); ‘daunceress’ (Ecclus. ix. 4); ‘neighbouress’
(Exod. iii. 22); ‘sinneress’ (Luke vii. 37);
‘purpuress’ (Acts xvi. 14); ‘cousiness’ (Luke i.
36); ‘slayeress’ (Tob. iii. 9); ‘devouress’
(Ezek. xxxvi. 13); ‘spousess’ (Prov. v. 19);
‘thralless’ (Jer. xxxiv. 16); ‘dwelleress’ (Jer.
xxi. 13); ‘waileress’ (Jer. ix. 17); ‘cheseress’
(=&nbsp;electrix, Wisd. viii. 4); ‘singeress’, ‘breakeress’,
‘waiteress’, this last indeed having recently
come up again. Add to these ‘chideress’, the
female chider, ‘herdess’, ‘constabless’, ‘moveress’,
‘jangleress’, ‘soudaness’ (=&nbsp;sultana),
<ins class="correction" title="original has semicolon instead of comma">‘guideress’,</ins>
‘charmeress’ (all in Chaucer); and
others, which however we may have now let
them fall, reached to far later periods of
the language; thus ‘vanqueress’ (Fabyan);
‘poisoneress’ (Greneway); ‘knightess’ (Udal);
‘pedleress’, ‘championess’, ‘vassaless’, ‘avengeress’,
‘warriouress’, ‘victoress’, ‘creatress’
(all in Spenser); ‘fornicatress’, ‘cloistress’, ‘join<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>tress’
(all in Shakespeare); ‘vowess’ (Holinshed);
‘ministress’, ‘flatteress’ (both in Holland);
‘captainess’ (Sidney); ‘saintess’ (Sir T. Urquhart);
‘heroess’, ‘dragoness’, ‘butleress’,
‘contendress’, ‘waggoness’, ‘rectress’ (all in
Chapman); ‘shootress’ (Fairfax); ‘archeress’
(Fanshawe); ‘clientess’, ‘pandress’ (both in
Middleton); ‘papess’, ‘Jesuitess’ (Bishop Hall);
‘incitress’ (Gayton); ‘soldieress’, ‘guardianess’,
‘votaress’ (all in Beaumont and Fletcher);
‘comfortress’, ‘fosteress’ (Ben Jonson); ‘soveraintess’
(Sylvester); ‘preserveress’ (Daniel);
‘solicitress’, ‘impostress’, ‘buildress’, ‘intrudress’
(all in Fuller); ‘favouress’ (Hakewell);
‘commandress’ (Burton); ‘monarchess’, ‘discipless’
(Speed); ‘auditress’, ‘cateress’, ‘chantress’,
‘tyranness’ (all in Milton); ‘citess’,
‘divineress’ (both in Dryden); ‘deaness’
(Sterne); ‘detractress’ (Addison); ‘hucksteress’
(Howell); ‘tutoress’ (Shaftesbury); ‘farmeress’
(Lord Peterborough, <i>Letter to Pope</i>); ‘laddess’,
which however still survives in the contracted
form of ‘lass’<a name="FNanchor_167_167" id="FNanchor_167_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a>; with more which, I doubt not,
it would not be very hard to bring
together<a name="FNanchor_168_168" id="FNanchor_168_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Words in ‘-ster’</i></div>

<p>Exactly the same thing has happened with
another feminine affix. I refer to ‘ster’, taking
the place of ‘er’ where a feminine doer is
in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>tended<a name="FNanchor_169_169" id="FNanchor_169_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a>.
‘Spinner’ and ‘spinster’ are the
only pair of such words, which still survive.
There were formerly many such; thus ‘baker’
had ‘bakester’, being the female who baked:
‘brewer’ ‘brewster’; ‘sewer’ ‘sewster’; ‘reader’
‘readster’; ‘seamer’ ‘seamster’; ‘fruiterer’
‘fruitester’; ‘tumbler’ ‘tumblester’; ‘hopper’
‘hoppester’ (these last three in Chaucer; “the
shippes <i>hoppesteres</i>”, about which so much
difficulty has been made, are the ships <i>dancing</i>,
i.e., on the
waves)<a name="FNanchor_170_170" id="FNanchor_170_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a>,
‘knitter’ ‘knitster’ (a word,
I am told, still alive in Devon). Add to these
‘whitster’ (female bleacher, Shakespeare), ‘kempster’
(pectrix), ‘dryster’ (siccatrix), ‘brawdster’,
(I suppose
embroideress)<a name="FNanchor_171_171" id="FNanchor_171_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a>,
and ‘salster’
(salinaria)<a name="FNanchor_172_172" id="FNanchor_172_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a>.
It is a singular example of the richness
of a language in forms at the earlier stages of its
existence, that not a few of the words which had,
as we have just seen, a feminine termination in
‘ess’, had also a second in ‘ster’. Thus ‘daunser’,
beside ‘daunseress’, had also ‘daunster’
(Ecclus. ix. 4); ‘wailer’, beside ‘waileress’,
had ‘wailster’ (Jer. ix. 17); ‘dweller’ ‘dwelster’
(Jer. xxi. 13); and ‘singer’ ‘singster’ (2 Kin.
xix. 35); so too, ‘chider’ had ‘chidester’
(Chaucer), as well as ‘chideress’, ‘slayer’ ‘slayster’
(Tob. iii. 9), as well as ‘slayeress’, ‘chooser’
‘chesister’, (Wisd. viii. 4), as well as ‘cheseress’,
with others that might be named.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span></p>

<p>It is difficult to understand how Marsh, with
these examples before him should affirm, “I
find no positive evidence to show that the termination
‘ster’ was ever regarded as a feminine
termination in English”. It may be, and indeed
has been, urged that the existence of such words
as ‘seamstr<i>ess</i>’, ‘songstr<i>ess</i>’, is decisive proof
that the ending ‘ster’ of itself was not counted
sufficient to designate persons as female; for if,
it has been said, ‘seam<i>ster</i>’ and ‘song<i>ster</i>’ had
been felt to be already feminine, no one would
have ever thought of doubling on this, and adding
a second female termination; ‘seam<i>stress</i>’, ‘song<i>stress</i>’.
But all which can justly be concluded
from hence is, that when this final ‘ess’ was
added to these already feminine forms, and examples
of it will not, I think, be found till a comparatively
late period of the language, the true principle
and law of the words had been lost sight of and
forgotten<a name="FNanchor_173_173" id="FNanchor_173_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a>.
The same may be affirmed of such
other of these feminine forms as are now applied
to men, such as ‘gamester’, ‘youngster’, ‘oldster’,
‘drugster’ (South), ‘huckster’, ‘hackster’,
(=&nbsp;swordsman, Milton, prose), ‘teamster’,
‘throw<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>ster’,
‘rhymester’, ‘punster’ (<i>Spectator</i>), ‘tapster’,
‘whipster’ (Shakespeare), ‘trickster’.
Either, like ‘teamster’, and ‘punster’, the
words first came into being, when the true significance
of this form was altogether
lost<a name="FNanchor_174_174" id="FNanchor_174_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a>; or like
‘tapster’, which was female in Chaucer (“the
gay <i>tapstere</i>”), as it is still in Dutch and Frisian,
and distinguished from ‘tapper’, the <i>man</i> who
keeps the inn, or has charge of the tap, or as
‘bakester’, at this day used in Scotland for
‘baker’, as ‘dyester’ for ‘dyer’, the word
did originally belong of right and exclusively
to women; but with the gradual transfer of the
occupation to men, and an increasing forgetfulness
of what this termination implied, there
went also a transfer of the
name<a name="FNanchor_175_175" id="FNanchor_175_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a>,
just as in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
other words, and out of the same causes, the
exact converse has found place; and ‘baker’ or
‘brewer’, not ‘bakester’ or
‘brewster’<a name="FNanchor_176_176" id="FNanchor_176_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a>, would
be now in England applied to the woman baking
or brewing. So entirely has this power of the
language died out, that it survives more apparently
than really even in ‘spinner’ and ‘spinster’;
seeing that ‘spinster’ has obtained now quite
another meaning than that of a woman spinning,
whom, as well as the man, we should call not a
‘spinster’, but a ‘spinner’<a name="FNanchor_177_177" id="FNanchor_177_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a>.

<span class="sidenote"><i>Deceptive Analogies</i></span>

It would indeed
be hard to believe, if we had not constant experience
of the fact, how soon and how easily the true
law and significance of some form, which has
never ceased to be in everybody’s mouth, may
yet be lost sight of by all. No more curious
chapter in the history of language could be
written than one which should trace the violations
of analogy, the transgressions of the most primary
laws of a language, which follow hereupon;
the plurals like ‘welkin’
(=&nbsp;wolken, the clouds)<a name="FNanchor_178_178" id="FNanchor_178_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a>,
‘chicken’<a name="FNanchor_179_179" id="FNanchor_179_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a>,
which are dealt with as
singulars,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>

which are
assumed to be plurals.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>The Genitival Inflexion ‘-s’</i></div>

<p>There is one example of this, familiar to us all;
probably so familiar that it would not be worth
while adverting to it, if it did not illustrate, as no
other word could, this forgetfulness which may
overtake a whole people, of the true meaning
of a grammatical form which they have never
ceased to employ. I refer to the mistaken assumption
that the ‘s’ of the genitive, as ‘the king’s
countenance’, was merely a more rapid way of
pronouncing ‘the king <i>his</i> countenance’, and
that the final ‘s’ in ‘king’s’ was in fact an
elided ‘his’. This explanation for a long time
prevailed almost universally; I believe there
are many who accept it still. It was in vain
that here and there a deeper knower of our tongue
protested against this “monstrous syntax”,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>as
Ben Jonson in his <i>Grammar</i> justly calls
it<a name="FNanchor_183_183" id="FNanchor_183_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a>.
It was in vain that Wallis, another English
scholar of the seventeenth century, pointed
out in <i>his</i> Grammar that the slightest examination
of the facts revealed the untenable
character of this explanation, seeing that we
do not merely say “the <i>king’s</i> countenance”,
but “the <i>queen’s</i> countenance”; and in this case
the final ‘s’ cannot stand for ‘his’, for “the
queen <i>his</i> countenance” cannot be intended<a name="FNanchor_184_184" id="FNanchor_184_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a>;
we do not say merely “the <i>child’s</i> bread”, but
“the <i>children’s</i> bread”, where it is no less impossible
to resolve the phrase into “the children <i>his</i>
bread”<a name="FNanchor_185_185" id="FNanchor_185_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a>. Despite of these protests the error
held its ground. This much indeed of a plea it
could make for itself, that such an actual employ<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>ment
of ‘his’ <i>had</i> found its way into the language,
as early as the fourteenth century, and had been
in occasional, though rare use, from that time
downward<a name="FNanchor_186_186" id="FNanchor_186_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a>. Yet this, which has only been
elicited by the researches of recent scholars,
does not in the least justify those who assumed
that in the habitual ‘s’ of the genitive were to
be found the remains of ‘his’&mdash;an error from
which the books of scholars in the seventeenth,
and in the early decades of the eighteenth, century
are not a whit clearer than those of others. Spenser,
Donne, Fuller, Jeremy Taylor, all fall into
it; I cannot say confidently whether Milton does.
Dryden more than once helps out his verse
with an additional syllable gained by its aid.
It has even forced its way into our Prayer Book
itself, where in the “Prayer for all sorts and
conditions of men”, added by Bishop Sanderson
at the last revision of the Liturgy in 1661,
we are bidden to say, “And this we beg for Jesus
Christ <i>his</i> sake”<a name="FNanchor_187_187" id="FNanchor_187_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a>. I need hardly tell you that
this ‘s’ is in fact the one remnant of flexion
surviving in the singular number of our English<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
noun substantives; it is in all the Indo-Germanic
languages the original sign of the genitive, or
at any rate the earliest of which we can take
cognizance; and just as in Latin ‘lapis’ makes
‘lapidis’ in the genitive, so ‘king’, ‘queen’,
‘child’, make severally ‘kings’, ‘queens’,
‘childs’, the comma, an apparent note of elision,
being a mere modern expedient, “a late refinement”,
as Ash calls it<a name="FNanchor_188_188" id="FNanchor_188_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a>, to distinguish the genitive
singular from the plural cases<a name="FNanchor_189_189" id="FNanchor_189_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Adjectives in ‘-en’</i></div>

<p>Notice another example of this willingness to
dispense with inflection, of this endeavour on the
part of the speakers of a language to reduce its
forms to the fewest possible, consistent with the
accurate communication of thought. Of our
adjectives in ‘en’, formed on substantives, and
expressing the material or substance of a thing,
some have gone, others are going, out of use;
while we content ourselves with the bare
juxtaposition of the substantive itself, as sufficiently
expressing our meaning. Thus instead of
“<i>golden</i> pin” we say “<i>gold</i> pin”; instead of
“<i>earthen</i> works” we say “<i>earth</i> works”. ‘Golden’
and ‘earthen’, it is true, still belong to our
living speech, though mainly as part of our poetic
diction, or of the solemn and thus stereotyped
language of Scripture; but a whole company of
such words have nearly or quite disappeared;
some lately, some long ago. ‘Steelen’ and
‘flowren’ belong only to the earliest period of
the language; ‘rosen’ also went early. Chaucer<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
is my latest authority for it (“<i>rosen</i> chapelet”).
‘Hairen’ is in Wiclif and in Chaucer; ‘stonen’
in the former (John iii. 6)<a name="FNanchor_190_190" id="FNanchor_190_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a>. ‘Silvern’ stood
originally in Wiclif’s Bible (“<i>silverne</i> housis to
Diane”, Acts xix. 24); but already in the second
recension of this was exchanged for ‘silver’;
‘hornen’, still in provincial use, he also employs,
and ‘clayen’ (Job iv. 19) no less. ‘Tinnen’
occurs in Sylvester’s <i>Du Bartas</i>; where also
we meet with “Jove’s <i>milken</i> alley”, as a name
for the <i>Via Lactea</i>, in Bacon also not “the
<i>Milky</i>”, but “the <i>Milken</i> Way”. In the coarse
polemics of the Reformation the phrase, “<i>breaden</i>
god”, provoked by the Romish doctrine of transubstantiation,
was of frequent employment, and
occurs as late as in Oldham. “<i>Mothen</i> parchments”
is in Fulke; “<i>twiggen</i> bottle” in
Shakespeare; ‘<i>yewen</i>’, or, according to earlier
spelling, “<i>ewghen</i> bow”, in Spenser; “<i>cedarn</i>
alley”, and “<i>azurn</i> sheen” are both in Milton;
“<i>boxen</i> leaves” in Dryden; “a <i>treen</i> cup” in
Jeremy Taylor; “<i>eldern</i> popguns” in Sir Thomas
Overbury; “a <i>glassen</i> breast”, in Whitlock;
“a <i>reeden</i> hat” in Coryat; ‘yarnen’ occurs in
Turberville; ‘furzen’ in Holland; ‘threaden’
in Shakespeare; and ‘bricken’, ‘papern’ appear
in our provincial glossaries as still in use.</p>

<p>It is true that many of these adjectives still<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
hold their ground; but it is curious to note how
the roots which sustain even these are being
gradually cut away from beneath them. Thus
‘brazen’ might at first sight seem as strongly
established in the language as ever; it is far from
so being; its supports are being cut from beneath
it. Even now it only lives in a tropical and
secondary sense, as ‘a <i>brazen</i> face’; or if in a
literal, in poetic diction or in the consecrated
language of Scripture, as ‘the <i>brazen</i> serpent’;
otherwise we say ‘a <i>brass</i> farthing’, ‘a <i>brass</i>
candlestick’. It is the same with ‘oaten’,
‘birchen’, ‘beechen’, ‘strawen’, and many more,
whereof some are obsolescent, some obsolete,
the language manifestly tending now, as it has
tended for a long time past, to the getting quit
of these, and to the satisfying of itself with an
adjectival apposition of the substantive in their
stead.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Weak and Strong Præterites</i></div>

<p>Let me illustrate by another example the way
in which a language, as it travels onward, simplifies
itself, approaches more and more to a grammatical
and logical uniformity, seeks to do the same
thing always in the same manner; where it
has two or three ways of conducting a single
operation, lets all of them go but one; and thus
becomes, no doubt, easier to be mastered, more
handy, more manageable; for its very riches
were to many an embarrassment and a perplexity;
but at the same time imposes limits and restraints
on its own freedom of action, and is in danger
of forfeiting elements of strength, variety and
beauty, which it once possessed. I refer to
the tendency of our verbs to let go their strong<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
præterites, and to substitute weak ones in their
room; or, where they have two or three præterites,
to retain only one of them, and that invariably
the weak one. Though many of us no doubt are
familiar with the terms ‘strong’ and ‘weak’
præterites, which in all our better grammars have
put out of use the wholly misleading terms,
‘irregular’ and ‘regular’, I may perhaps as well
remind you of the exact meaning of the terms.
A strong præterite is one formed by an internal
vowel change; for instance the verb ‘to <i>drive</i>’
forms the præterite ‘<i>drove</i>’ by an internal change
of the vowel ‘i’ into ‘o’. But why, it may be
asked, called ‘strong’? In respect of the vigour
and indwelling energy in the word, enabling it
to form its past tense from its own resources, and
with no calling in of help from without. On the
other hand ‘lift’ forms its præterite ‘lift<i>ed</i>’,
not by any internal change, but by the addition
of ‘ed’; ‘grieve’ in like manner has ‘griev<i>ed</i>’.
Here are weak tenses; as strength was ascribed
to the other verbs, so weakness to these, which
can form their præterites only by external aid
and addition. You will see at once that these
strong præterites, while they witness to a vital
energy in the words which are able to put them
forth, do also, as must be allowed by all, contribute
much to the variety and charm of a
language<a name="FNanchor_191_191" id="FNanchor_191_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a>.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>

<p>The point, however, which I am urging now is
this,&mdash;that these are becoming fewer every day;
multitudes of them having disappeared, while
others are in the act of disappearing. Nor is
the balance redressed and compensation found
in any new creations of the kind. The power
of forming strong præterites is long ago extinct;
probably no verb which has come into the language
since the Conquest has asserted this power, while
a whole legion have let it go. For example,
‘shape’ has now a weak præterite, ‘shaped’,
it had once a strong one, ‘shope’; ‘bake’ has
now a weak præterite, ‘baked’, it had once a
strong one, ‘boke’; the præterite of ‘glide’
is now ‘glided’, it was once ‘glode’ or ‘glid’;
‘help’ makes now ‘helped’, it made once ‘halp’
and ‘holp’. ‘Creep’ made ‘crope’, still current
in the north of England; ‘weep’ ‘wope’;
‘yell’ ‘yoll’ (both in Chaucer); ‘seethe’ ‘soth’
or ‘sod’ (Gen. xxv. 29); ‘sheer’ in like manner
once made ‘shore’; as ‘leap’ made ‘lope’;
‘wash’ ‘wishe’ (Chaucer); ‘snow’ ‘snew’;
‘sow’ ‘sew’; ‘delve’ ‘dalf’ and ‘dolve’;
‘sweat’ ‘swat’; ‘yield’ ‘yold’ (both in

<div class="sidenote"><i>Strong Præterites</i></div>

<p>Observe further that where verbs have not
actually renounced their strong præterites, and
contented themselves with weak in their room,
yet, once possessing two, or, it might be three of
these strong, they now retain only one. The
others, on the principle of dismissing whatever can
be dismissed, they have let go. Thus ‘chide’ had
once ‘chid’ and ‘chode’, but though ‘chode’
is in our Bible (Gen. xxxi. 36), it has not maintained
itself in our speech; ‘sling’ had ‘slung’ and
‘slang’ (1 Sam. xvii. 49); only ‘slung’ remains;
‘fling’ had once ‘flung’ and ‘flang’; ‘strive’
had ‘strove’ and ‘strave’; ‘stick’ had ‘stuck’
and ‘stack’; ‘hang’ had ‘hung’ and ‘hing’
(Golding); ‘tread’ had ‘trod’ and ‘trad’;
‘choose’ had ‘chose’ and ‘chase’; ‘give’
had ‘gave’ and ‘gove’; ‘lead’ had ‘led’ ‘lad’
and ‘lode’; ‘write’ had ‘wrote’ ‘writ’ and
‘wrate’. In all these cases, and more might
easily be cited, only [of] the præterites which I
have named the first remains in use.</p>

<p>Observe too that in every instance where a conflict
is now going on between weak and strong
forms, which shall continue, the battle is not to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
the strong; on the contrary the weak is carrying
the day, is getting the better of its stronger competitor.
Thus ‘climbed’ is gaining the upper hand
of ‘clomb’, ‘swelled’ of ‘swoll’, ‘hanged’ of
‘hung’. It is not too much to anticipate that a
time will come, although it may be still far off,
when all English verbs will form their præterites
weakly; not without serious damage to the fulness
and force which in this respect the language even
now displays, and once far more eminently displayed<a name="FNanchor_193_193" id="FNanchor_193_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Comparatives and Superlatives</i></div>

<p>Take another proof of this tendency in our own
language to drop its forms and renounce its own
inherent powers; though here also the renunciation,
threatening one day to be complete, is only
partial at the present. I refer to the formation
of our comparatives and superlatives; and I will
ask you again to observe here that curious law
of language, namely, that wherever there are two
or more ways of attaining the same result, there
is always a disposition to drop and dismiss all of
these but one, so that the alternative or choice of
ways once existing, shall not exist any more. If
only it can attain a greater simplicity, it seems
to grudge no self-impoverishment by which this
result may be brought about. We have two ways
of forming our comparatives and superlatives, one
dwelling in the word itself, which we have inherited
from our old Gothic stock, as ‘bright’, ‘bright<i>er</i>’,
‘bright<i>est</i>’, the other supplementary to this, by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
prefixing the auxiliaries ‘more’ and ‘most’. The
first, organic we might call it, the indwelling power
of the word to mark its own degrees, must needs
be esteemed the more excellent way; which yet,
already disallowed in almost all adjectives of more
than two syllables in length, is daily becoming of
narrower and more restrained application. Compare
in this matter our present with our past.
Wiclif for example forms such comparatives as
‘grievouser’, ‘gloriouser’, ‘patienter’, ‘profitabler’,
such superlatives as
‘<ins class="correction" title="original reads ‘griveousest’">grievousest</ins>’, ‘famousest’;
this last occurring also in Bacon. We meet
in Tyndale, ‘excellenter’, ‘miserablest’; in
Shakespeare, ‘violentest’; in Gabriel Harvey,
‘vendiblest’, ‘substantialest’, ‘insolentest’; in
Rogers, ‘insufficienter’, ‘goldener’; in Beaumont
and Fletcher, ‘valiantest’. Milton uses ‘virtuosest’,
and in prose ‘vitiosest’, ‘elegantest’, ‘artificialest’,
‘servilest’, ‘sheepishest’, ‘resolutest’,
‘sensualest’; Fuller has ‘fertilest’; Baxter
‘tediousest’; Butler ‘preciousest’, ‘intolerablest’;
Burnet ‘copiousest’, Gray ‘impudentest’.
Of these forms, and it would be easy to adduce
almost any number, we should hardly employ any
now. In participles and adverbs in ‘ly’, these
organic comparatives and superlatives hardly
survive at all. We do not say ‘willinger’ or
‘lovinger’, and still less ‘flourishingest’, or
‘shiningest’, or ‘surmountingest’, all which
Gabriel Harvey, a foremost master of the English
of his time, employs; ‘plenteouslyer’, ‘fulliest’
(Wiclif), ‘easiliest’ (Fuller), ‘plainliest’ (Dryden),
would be all inadmissible at present.</p>

<p>In the manifest tendency of English at the pre<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>sent
moment to reduce the number of words in
which this more vigorous scheme of expressing
degrees is allowed, we must recognize an evidence
that the energy which the language had in its
youth is in some measure abating, and the stiffness
of age overtaking it. Still it is with us here
only as it is with all languages, in which at a
certain time of their life auxiliary words, leaving
the main word unaltered, are preferred to inflections
of this last. Such preference makes itself
ever more strongly felt; and, judging from analogy,
I cannot doubt that a day, however distant
now, will arrive, when the only way of forming
comparatives and superlatives in the English
language will be by prefixing ‘more’ and ‘most’;
or, if the other survive, it will be in poetry alone.</p>

<p>It will fare not otherwise, as I am bold to predict,
with the flexional genitive, formed in ‘s’ or ‘es’
(see <a href="#Page_161">p. 161</a>). This too will finally disappear altogether
from the language, or will survive only in poetry,
and as much an archaic form there as the ‘pictaï’
of Virgil. A time will come when it will not any
longer be free to say, as now, either, “<i>the king’s
sons</i>”, or “<i>the sons of the king</i>”, but when the
latter will be the only admissible form. Tokens
of this are already evident. The region in which
the alternative forms are equally good is
narrowing. We should not now any more write,
“When <i>man’s son</i> shall come” (Wiclif), but “When
<i>the Son of man</i> shall come”, nor yet, “<i>The hypocrite’s
hope</i> shall perish” (Job viii. 13, Authorized
Version), but, “<i>The hope of the hypocrite</i>
shall perish”; not with Barrow, “No man can
be ignorant <i>of human life’s brevity and uncer<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>tainty</i>”,
but “No man can be ignorant <i>of the
brevity and uncertainty of human life</i>”. The consummation
which I anticipate may be centuries
off, but will assuredly arrive<a name="FNanchor_194_194" id="FNanchor_194_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Lost Diminutives</i></div>

<p>Then too diminutives are fast disappearing
from the language. If we desire to express smallness,
we prefer to do it by an auxiliary word;
thus a little fist, and not a ‘fistock’ (Golding), a
little lad, and not a ‘ladkin’, a little worm, rather
than a ‘wormling’ (Sylvester). It is true that of
diminutives very many still survive, in all our four
terminations of such, as ‘hillock’, ‘streamlet’,
‘lambkin’, ‘gosling’; but those which have
perished are many more. Where now is ‘kingling’
(Holland), ‘whimling’ (Beaumont and Fletcher),
‘godling’, ‘loveling’, ‘dwarfling’,
‘<ins class="correction" title="original reads ‘sherperdling’">shepherdling</ins>’
(all in Sylvester), ‘chasteling’ (Bacon),
‘niceling’ (Stubbs), ‘fosterling’ (Ben Johnson),
and ‘masterling’? Where now ‘porelet’
(=&nbsp;paupercula, Isai. x. 30, Vulg.), ‘bundelet’,
(both in Wiclif); ‘cushionet’ (Henry More),
‘havenet’, or little ‘haven’, ‘pistolet’, ‘bulkin’
(Holland), and a hundred more? Even of those
which remain many are putting off, or have long
since put off, their diminutive sense; a ‘pocket’
being no longer a <i>small</i> poke, nor a ‘latchet’ a
<i>small</i> lace, nor a ‘trumpet’ a small <i>trump</i>, as
once they were.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Thou and Thee</i></div>

<p>Once more&mdash;in the entire dropping among the
higher classes of ‘thou’, except in poetry or in
addresses to the Deity, and as a necessary consequence,
the dropping also of the second singular of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
the verb with its strongly marked flexion, as
‘lovest’, ‘lovedst’, we have another example of a
force once existing in the language, which has been,
or is being, allowed to expire. In the seventeenth
century ‘thou’ in English, as at the present ‘du’
in German, ‘tu’ in French, was the sign of familiarity,
whether that familiarity was of love, or of
contempt and scorn<a name="FNanchor_195_195" id="FNanchor_195_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a>. It was not unfrequently
the latter. Thus at Sir Walter Raleigh’s trial
(1603), Coke, when argument and evidence failed
him, insulted the defendant by applying to him
the term ‘thou’:&mdash;“All that Lord Cobham did
was at <i>thy</i> instigation, <i>thou</i> viper, for I <i>thou</i> thee,
<i>thou</i> traitor”. And when Sir Toby Belch in
<i>Twelfth Night</i> is urging Sir Andrew Aguecheek
to send a sufficiently provocative challenge to
Viola, he suggests to him that he “taunt him
with the licence of ink; if thou <i>thou’st</i> him some
thrice, it shall not be amiss”. To keep this in
mind will throw much light on one peculiarity of
the Quakers, and give a certain dignity to it, as
once maintained, which at present it is very far
from possessing. However needless and unwise
their determination to ‘thee’ and ‘thou’ the whole
world was, yet this had a significance. It was not,
as now to us it seems, and, through the silent
changes which language has undergone, as now it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
indeed is, a gratuitous departure from the ordinary
usage of society. Right or wrong, it meant something,
and had an ethical motive: being indeed
a testimony upon their parts, however misplaced,
that they would not have high or great or rich
men’s persons in admiration; nor give the observance
to some which they withheld from others.
It was a testimony too which cost them something;
at present we can very little understand the amount
of courage which this ‘thou-ing’ and ‘thee-ing’ of
all men must have demanded on their parts, nor
yet the amount of indignation and offence which
it stirred up in them who were not aware of, or
would not allow for, the scruples which obliged
them to it<a name="FNanchor_196_196" id="FNanchor_196_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a>. It is, however, in its other aspect that
we must chiefly regret the dying out of the use of
‘thou’&mdash;that is, as the pledge of peculiar intimacy
and special affection, as between husband and
wife, parents and children, and such other as
might be knit together by bands of more than
common affection.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Gender Words</i></div>

<p>I have preferred during this lecture to find my
theme in changes which are now going forward
in English, but I cannot finish it without drawing
one illustration from its remoter periods, and
bidding you to note a force not now waning and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
failing from it, but extinct long ago. I cannot
well pass it by; being as it is by far the boldest
step which in this direction of simplification the
English language has at any time taken. I refer to
the renouncing of the distribution of its nouns
into masculine, feminine, and neuter, as in German,
or even into masculine and feminine, as in French;
and with this, and as a necessary consequence of
this, the dropping of any flexional modification in
the adjectives connected with them. Natural <i>sex</i>
of course remains, being inherent in all language;
but grammatical <i>gender</i>, with the exception of ‘he’,
‘she’, and ‘it’, and perhaps one or two other
fragmentary instances, the language has altogether
forgone. An example will make clear the distinction
between these. Thus it is not the word
‘poetess’ which is <i>feminine</i>, but the person indicated
who is <i>female</i>. So too ‘daughter’, ‘queen’,
are in English not <i>feminine</i> nouns, but nouns
designating <i>female</i> persons. Take on the contrary
‘filia’ or ‘regina’, ‘fille’ or ‘reine’; there
you have <i>feminine</i> nouns as well as <i>female</i> persons.
I need hardly say to you that we did not inherit
this simplicity from others, but, like the Danes, in
so far as they have done the like, have made it for
ourselves. Whether we turn to the Latin, or,
which is for us more important, to the old Gothic,
we find gender; and in all daughter languages which
have descended from the Latin, in most of those
which have descended from the ancient Gothic
stock, it is fully established to this day. The
practical, business-like character of the English
mind asserted itself in the rejection of a distinction,
which in a vast proportion of words, that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
is, in all which are the signs of <i>inanimate</i> objects,
and as such incapable of sex, rested upon a fiction,
and had no ground in the real nature of things.
It is only by an act and effort of the imagination
that sex, and thus gender, can be attributed to a
table, a ship, or a tree; and there are aspects, this
being one, in which the English is among the least
imaginative of all languages even while it has been
employed in some of the mightiest works of imagination
which the world has ever seen<a name="FNanchor_197_197" id="FNanchor_197_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a>.</p>

<p>What, it may be asked, is the meaning and explanation
of all this? It is that at certain earlier
periods of a nation’s life its genius is synthetic,
and at later becomes analytic. At earlier periods
all is by synthesis; and men love to contemplate
the thing, and the mode of the thing, together, as
a single idea, bound up in one. But a time arrives
when the intellectual obtains the upper hand of
the imaginative, when the tendency of those
that speak the language is to analyse, to distinguish
between these two, and not only to distinguish
but to divide, to have one word for the
thing itself, and another for the quality of the
thing; and this, as it would appear, is true not of
some languages only, but of all.</p>

With all its severity, there is some truth in Ben
Johnson’s observation: “Spenser, in affecting the ancients,
writ no language”. In this matter, however, Ben Jonson
was at one with him; for he does not hesitate to express
his strong regret that this form has not been retained.
“The <i>persons</i> plural” he says (<i>English Grammar</i>, c. 17),
“keep the termination of the first <i>person</i> singular. In
former times, till about the reign of King Henry VIII,
they were wont to be formed by adding <i>en</i>; thus, <i>loven</i>,
<i>sayen</i>, <i>complainen</i>. But now (whatsoever is the cause)
it hath quite grown out of use, and that other so generally
prevailed, that I dare not presume to set this afoot again;
albeit (to tell you my opinion) I am persuaded that the
lack hereof, well considered, will be found a great blemish
to our tongue. For seeing <i>time</i> and <i>person</i> be as it were
the right and left hand of a verb, what can the maiming

I cannot doubt that this form which our country
people in Hampshire, as in many other parts, always
employ, either retains the original pronunciation, our
received one being a modern corruption; or else, as is
more probable, that <i>we</i> have made a confusion between
two originally different words, from which they have
kept clear. Thus in Howell’s <i>Vocabulary</i>, 1659, and in
Cotgrave’s <i>French and English Dictionary</i> both words
occur: “nuncion or nuncheon, the afternoon’s repast”,
(cf. <i>Hudibras</i>, i. 1, 346: “They took their breakfasts or
their <i>nuncheons</i>”), and “lunchion, a big piece” i.e. of
bread; for both give the old French ‘caribot’, which has
this meaning, as the equivalent of ‘luncheon’. It is
clear that in this sense of lump or ‘big piece’ Gay uses
‘luncheon’:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“When hungry thou stood’st staring like an oaf,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I sliced the <i>luncheon</i> from the barley loaf”;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>and Miss Baker in her <i>Northamptonshire Glossary</i> explains
‘lunch’ as “a large lump of bread, or other edible; ‘He
helped himself to a good <i>lunch</i> of cake’”. We may note
further that this ‘nuntion’ may possibly put us on the
right track for arriving at the etymology of the word.
Richardson has called attention to the fact that it is spelt
“noon-shun” in Browne’s <i>Pastorals</i>, which must at least
suggest as possible and plausible that the ‘nuntion’
was originally applied to the labourer’s slight meal, to
which he withdrew for the <i>shunning</i> of the heat of the
middle <i>noon</i>: especially when in Lancashire we find a
word of similar formation, ‘noon-scape’, and in Norfolk
‘noon-miss’, for the time when labourers rest after
dinner. [It really stands for the older English <i>none-schenche</i>,
i.e. ‘noon-skink’ or noon-drink (see Skeat,
<i>Etym. Dict.</i>, <i>s.v.</i>), correlative to ‘noon-meat’ or ‘nam-met’.]
It is at any rate certain that the dignity to which
‘lunch’ or ‘luncheon’ has now arrived, as when we
read in the newspapers of a “magnificent <i>luncheon</i>”, is
altogether modern; the word belonged a century ago to
rustic life, and in literature had not travelled beyond
the “hobnailed pastorals” which professed to describe
that life.</p></div>

This last very curious usage, which served as a kind
of stepping-stone to ‘its’, and of which another example
occurs in the Geneva Version (Acts xii. 10), and three or
four in Shakespeare, has been abundantly illustrated by
those who have lately written on the early history of the
word ‘its’; thus see Craik, <i>On the English of Shakespeare</i>,

The earliest example which Richardson gives of
‘seamstress’ is from Gay, of ‘songstress’, from Thomson.
I find however ‘sempstress’ in the translation of
Olearius’ <i>Voyages and Travels</i>, 1669, p. 43. It is quite
certain that as late as Ben Jonson, ‘seamster’ and
‘songster’ expressed the <i>female</i> seamer and singer; a
single passage from his <i>Masque of Christmas</i> is evidence
to this. One of the children of Christmas there is
“Wassel, like a neat <i>sempster</i> and <i>songster</i>; <i>her</i> page
bearing a brown bowl”. Compare a passage from
<i>Holland’s Leaguer</i>, 1632: “A <i>tyre-woman</i> of phantastical

no doubt that it is the same in <i>Othello</i>, Act i. Sc. 1. And
a little later, in Howell’s <i>Vocabulary</i>, 1659, ‘spinner’ and
‘spinster’ are <i>both</i> referred to the male sex, and the
barbarous ‘spinstress’ invented for the female.</p></div>

I have included ‘huckster’, as will be observed, in
this list. I certainly cannot produce any passage in
which it is employed as the <i>female</i> pedlar. We have only,
however, to keep in mind the existence of the verb ‘to
huck’, in the sense of to peddle (it is used by Bishop
Andrews), and at the same time not to let the present
spelling of ‘hawker’ mislead us, and we shall confidently
recognize ‘hucker’ (the German ‘höker’ or ‘höcker’),
in hawker, that is, the <i>man</i> who ‘hucks’, ‘hawks’, or
peddles, as in ‘huckster’ the <i>female</i> who does the same.
When therefore Howell and others employ ‘hucksteress’,
they fall into the same barbarous excess of expression,
whereof we are all guilty, when we use ‘seamstress’ and
‘songstress’.&mdash;The note stood thus in the third edition.
Since that was published, I have met in the <i>Nominale</i>
referred to p. 155, the following, “hæc auxiatrix, a

a correspondent writes, they would as soon think of saying
‘oxens’ as ‘chickens’. [‘Chicken’ is properly a
singular, old English <i>cicen</i>, the <i>-en</i> being a diminutival,
not a plural, suffix (as in ‘kitten’, ‘maiden’). Thus
‘chicken’ was originally ‘a little chuck’ (or cock), out
of which ‘chick’ was afterwards developed.]</p></div>

I cannot think that it would exceed the authority
of our University Presses, if this were removed from the
Prayer Books which they put forth, as certainly it is supprest
by many of the clergy in the reading. Such a liberty
they have already assumed with the Bible. In all earlier
editions of the Authorized Version it stood at 1 Kin. xv.
24: “Nevertheless <i>Asa his</i> heart was perfect with the
Lord”; it is “<i>Asa’s</i> heart” now. In the same way
“<i>Mordecai his</i> matters” (Esth. iii. 4) has been silently
changed into “<i>Mordecai’s</i> matters”; and in some modern

The entire ignorance as to the past historic evolution
of the language, with which some have undertaken to
write about it, is curious. Thus the author of <i>Observations
upon the English Language</i>, without date, but published
about 1730, treats all these strong præterites as of
recent introduction, counting ‘knew’ to have lately
expelled ‘knowed’, ‘rose’ to have acted the same part
toward ‘rised’, and of course esteeming them as so many
barbarous violations of the laws of the language; and
concluding with the warning that “great care must be
taken to prevent their increase”!!&mdash;p. 24. Cobbett
does not fall into this absurdity, yet proposes in his

inconvenient. [Now many others are rapidly becoming

<h3>CHANGES IN THE MEANING OF ENGLISH WORDS</h3>


<p>I propose, according to the plan sketched out
in my first lecture, to take for my subject in the
present those changes which in the course of time
have found place, or now are finding place, in
the meaning of many among our English words;
so that, whether we are aware of it or not, we
employ them at this day in senses very different
from those in which our forefathers employed
them of old. You observe that it is not <i>obsolete</i>
words, words quite fallen out of present use,
which I propose to consider; but such, rather, as
are still on the lips of men, but with meanings
more or less removed from those which once they
possessed. My subject is far more practical,
has far more to do with your actual life, than if
I had taken obsolete words, and considered them.
These last have an interest indeed, but it is an
interest of an antiquarian character. They constituted
a part of the intellectual money with
which our ancestors carried on the business of
their life; but now they are rather medals for the
cabinets and collections of the curious than current
money for the needs and pleasures of all.
Their wings are clipped, so that they are “<i>winged<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span></i>
words” no more; the spark of thought or feeling,
kindling from mind to mind, no longer runs along
them, as along the electric wires of the soul.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Obsolete Words</i></div>

<p>And then, besides this, there is little or no danger
that any should be misled by them. A reader
lights for the first time on one of these obsolete
English words, as ‘frampold’, or ‘garboil’, or
‘brangle’<a name="FNanchor_198_198" id="FNanchor_198_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a>; he is at once conscious of his ignorance;
he has recourse to a glossary, of if he guesses
from the context at the word’s signification, still
his guess is as a guess to him, and no more. But
words that have changed their meaning have
often a deceivableness about them; a reader not
once doubts but that he knows their intention, has
no misgiving but that they possess for him the
same force which they possessed for their writer,
and conveyed to <i>his</i> contemporaries, when indeed
it is quite otherwise. The old life has gone out
of them and a new life entered in.</p>

<p>Thus, for example, a reader of our day lights
upon such a passage as the following (it is from
the <i>Preface</i> to Howell’s <i>Lexicon</i>, 1660): “Though
the root of the English language be <i>Dutch</i><a name="FNanchor_199_199" id="FNanchor_199_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a>, yet
it may be said to have been inoculated afterwards
on a French stock”. He may know that the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
Dutch is a sister language or dialect to our own;
but this that it is the mother or root of it will
certainly perplex him, and he will hardly know
what to make of the assertion; perhaps he ascribes
it to an error in his author, who is thereby unduly
lowered in his esteem. But presently in the
course of his reading he meets with the following
statement, this time in Fuller’s <i>Holy War</i>, being
a history of the Crusades: “The French, <i>Dutch</i>,
Italian, and English were the four elemental
nations, whereof this army [of the Crusaders] was
compounded”. If the student has sufficient
historical knowledge to know that in the time of
the Crusades there were no Dutch in our use of
the word, this statement would merely startle
him; and probably before he had finished the
chapter, having his attention once aroused, he
would perceive that Fuller with the writers of his
time used ‘Dutch’ for German; even as it was
constantly so used up to the end of the seventeenth
century; and as the Americans use it to this
present day; what we call now a Dutchman
being then a Hollander. But a young student
might very possibly want that amount of previous
knowledge, which should cause him to receive
this announcement with misgiving and surprise;
and thus he might carry away altogether a wrong
impression, and rise from a perusal of the book,
persuaded that the Dutch, as we call them, played
an important part in the Crusades, while the
Germans took little or no part in them at all.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Miscreant</i></div>

<p>And as it is here with an historic fact, so still
more often will it happen with the subtler changes
which words have undergone. Out of this it
will<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
continually happen that they convey now much
more blame and condemnation, or convey now
much less, than formerly they did; or of a different
kind; and a reader not aware of the altered value
which they now possess, may be in continual
danger of misreading his author, of misunderstanding
his intentions, while he has no doubt
whatever that he perfectly apprehends and takes
it in. Thus when Shakespeare in
<i><ins class="correction" title="original reads ‘I’">1</ins> Henry VI</i>
makes the gallant York address Joan of Arc as
a ‘miscreant’, how coarse a piece of invective
this sounds; how unlike what the chivalrous
soldier would have uttered; or what one might
have supposed Shakespeare, even with his unworthy
estimate of the holy warrior Maid, would
have put into his mouth. But a ‘miscreant’
in Shakespeare’s time had nothing of the meaning
which now it has. It was simply, in agreement
with its etymology, a misbeliever, one who did
not believe rightly the Articles of the Catholic
Faith. And I need not remind you that this
was the constant charge which the English brought
against Joan,&mdash;namely, that she was a dealer
in hidden magical arts, a witch, and as such had
fallen from the faith. On this plea they burnt
her, and it is this which York means when he
calls her a ‘miscreant’, and not what we should
intend by the name.</p>

<p>In reading of poetry above all what beauties
are often missed, what forces lost, through this
assumption that the present of a word is always
equivalent to its past. How often the poet is
wronged in our estimation; that seeming to us
now flat and pointless, which at once would
lose<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
this character, did we know how to read into some
word the emphasis which it once had, but which
now has departed from it. For example, Milton
ascribes in <i>Comus</i> the “<i>tinsel-slippered</i> feet” to
Thetis, the goddess of the sea. How comparatively
poor an epithet this ‘tinsel-slippered’
sounds for those who know of ‘tinsel’ only in its
modern acceptation of mean and tawdry finery,
affecting a splendour which it does not really possess.
But learn its earlier use by learning its derivation,
bring it back to the French ‘étincelle’, and the
Latin ‘scintillula’; see in it, as Milton and the
writers of his time saw, ‘the sparkling’, and how
exquisitely beautiful a title does this become applied
to a goddess of the sea; how vividly does it call up
before our mind’s eye the quick glitter and sparkle
of the waves under the light of sun or
moon<a name="FNanchor_200_200" id="FNanchor_200_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a>.
It is Homer’s ‘silver-footed’ (<span title="Greek: argyropeza">ἀργυρόπεζα</span>), not
servilely transferred, but reproduced and made
his own by the English poet, dealing as one
great poet will do with another; who will not
disdain to borrow, but to what he borrows will
add often a further grace of his own.</p>

<div class="sidenote">‘<i>Influence</i>’</div>

<p>Or, again, do we keep in mind, or are we even
aware, that whenever the word ‘influence’ occurs
in our English poetry, down to comparatively a
modern date, there is always more or less remote
allusions to invisible illapses of power, skyey,
planetary effects, supposed to be exercised by the
heavenly luminaries upon the lives of
men<a name="FNanchor_201_201" id="FNanchor_201_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a>?
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
How many a passage starts into new life and
beauty and fulness of allusion, when this is present
with us; even Milton’s</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">“store of ladies, whose bright eyes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rain <i>influence</i>”,<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>as spectators of the tournament, gain something,
when we regard them&mdash;and using this language,
he intended we should&mdash;as the luminaries of this
lower sphere, shedding by their propitious presence
strength and valour into the hearts of their
knights.</p>

<div class="sidenote">‘<i>Baffle</i>’</div>

<p>The word even in its present acceptation may
yield, as here, a convenient and even a correct
sense; we may fall into no positive misapprehension
about it; and still, through ignorance of its
past history and of the force which it once possessed,
we may miss a great part of its significance.
We are not <i>beside</i> the meaning of our author,
but we are <i>short</i> of it. Thus in Beaumont and
Fletcher’s <i>King and no King</i>, (Act iii. Sc. 2,) a
cowardly braggart of a soldier describes the treatment
he experienced, when like Parolles he was at
length found out, and stripped of his lion’s skin:&mdash;“They
hung me up by the heels and beat me with
hazel sticks, ... that the whole kingdom took
notice of me for a <i>baffled</i>, whipped fellow”. The
word to which I wish here to call your attention
is ‘baffled’. Were you reading this passage, there
would probably be nothing here to cause you to
pause; you would attach to ‘baffled’ a sense
which sorts very well with the context&mdash;“hung up
by the heels and beaten, all his schemes of being
thought much of were <i>baffled</i> and defeated”. But
“baffled” implies far more than this; it contains<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
allusion to a custom in the days of chivalry,
according to which a perjured or recreant knight
was either in person, or more commonly in effigy,
hung up by the heels, his scutcheon blotted, his
spear broken, and he himself or his effigy made
the mark and subject of all kinds of indignities;
such a one being said to be ‘baffled’<a name="FNanchor_202_202" id="FNanchor_202_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a>. Twice
in Spenser recreant knights are so dealt with. I
can only quote a portion of the shorter passage,
in which this infamous punishment is described:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“And after all, for greater infamy<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He by the heels him hung upon a tree,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And <i>baffled</i> so, that all which passéd by<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The picture of his punishment might
see”<a name="FNanchor_203_203" id="FNanchor_203_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a>.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Probably when Beaumont and Fletcher wrote, men
were not so remote from the days of chivalry,
or at any rate from the literature of chivalry, but
that this custom was still fresh in their minds.
How much more to them than to us, so long as
we are ignorant of the same, would those words
<ins class="correction" title="original reads ‘justI’">I just</ins>
quoted have conveyed?</p>

<div class="sidenote">‘<i>Religion</i>’</div>

<p>There are several places in the Authorized Version
of Scripture where those who are not aware
of the changes which have taken place during the
last two hundred and fifty years in our language,
can hardly fail of being to a certain extent misled
as to the intention of our Translators; or, if they
are better acquainted with Greek than with early
English, will be tempted to ascribe to them, though
unjustly, an inexact rendering of the original.
Thus the altered meaning of a word involves a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
serious misunderstanding in that well known
statement of St. James, “Pure <i>religion</i> and undefiled
before God and the Father is this, to visit
the fatherless and widows in their affliction”.
“There”, exclaims one who wishes to set up St.
James against St. Paul, that so he may escape
the necessity of obeying either, “listen to what
St. James says; there is nothing mystical in what
he requires; instead of harping on faith as a condition
necessary to salvation, he makes all religion
to consist in practical deeds of kindness from one
to another”. But let us pause for a moment.
Did ‘religion’, when our translation was made,
mean godliness? did it mean the <i>sum total</i> of our
duties towards God? for, of course, no one would
deny that deeds of charity are a necessary part of
our Christian duty, an evidence of the faith which
is in us. There is abundant evidence to show
that ‘religion’ did not mean this; that, like the
Greek <span title="Greek: thrêskeia">θρησκεία</span>,
for which it here stands, like the
Latin ‘religio’, it meant the outward forms and
embodiments in which the inward principle of
piety arrayed itself, the <i>external service</i> of God;
and St. James is urging upon those to whom he
is writing something of this kind: “Instead of
the ceremonial services of the Jews, which consisted
in divers washings and in other elements of
this world, let our service, our
<span title="Greek: thrêskeia">θρησκεία</span>, take a
nobler shape, let it consist in deeds of pity and
of love”&mdash;and it was this which our Translators
intended, when they used ‘religion’ here and
‘religious’ in the verse preceding. How little
‘religion’ once meant godliness, how predominantly
it was used for the <i>outward</i> service of God, is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
plain from many passages in our <i>Homilies</i>, and
from other contemporary literature.</p>

<p>Again, there are words in our Liturgy which
I have no doubt are commonly misunderstood.
The mistake involves no serious error; yet still in
our own language, and in words which we have
constantly in our mouths, and at most solemn
times, it is certainly better to be right than wrong.
In the Litany we pray God that it would please
Him, “to give and preserve to our use the <i>kindly</i>
fruits of the earth”. What meaning do we
attach to this epithet, “the <i>kindly</i> fruits of the
earth”? Probably we understand by it those
fruits in which the <i>kindness</i> of God or of nature
towards us finds its expression. This is no unworthy
explanation, but still it is not the right
one. The “<i>kindly</i> fruits” are the “<i>natural</i>
fruits”, those which the earth according to its
<i>kind</i> should naturally bring forth, which it is appointed
to produce. To show you how little
‘kindly’ meant once benignant, as it means now,
I will instance an employment of it from Sir Thomas
More’s <i>Life of Richard the Third</i>. He tells us that
Richard calculated by murdering his two nephews
in the Tower to make himself accounted “a
<i>kindly</i> king”&mdash;not certainly a ‘kindly’ one in
our present usage of the word<a name="FNanchor_204_204" id="FNanchor_204_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a>; but, having put
them out of the way, that he should then be lineal
heir of the Crown, and should thus be reckoned<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
as king <i>by kind</i> or natural descent; and such was
of old the constant use of the word.</p>

<div class="sidenote">‘<i>Worship</i>’</div>

<p>A phrase in one of our occasional Services
“with my body I thee <i>worship</i>”, has sometimes
offended those who are unacquainted with the
early use of English words, and thus with the
intention of the actual framers of that Service.
Clearly in our modern sense of ‘worship’, this
language would be unjustifiable. But ‘worship’
or ‘worthship’ meant ‘honour’ in our early
English, and ‘to worship’ to honour, this meaning
of ‘worship’ still very harmlessly surviving in the
title of “your worship”, addressed to the magistrate
on the bench. So little was it restrained of
old to the honour which man is bound to pay to
God, that it was employed by Wiclif to express
the honour which God will render to his faithful
servants and friends. Thus our Lord’s declaration
“If any man serve Me, him will my Father <i>honour</i>”,
in Wiclif’s translation reads thus, “If any man
serve Me, my Father shall <i>worship</i> him”. I do
not say that there is not sufficient reason to change
the words, “with my body I thee <i>worship</i>”, if
only there were any means of changing anything
which is now antiquated and out of date in our
services or arrangements. I think it would be
very well if they were changed, liable as they are
to misunderstanding and misconstruction now;
but still they did not mean at the first, and therefore
do not now really mean, any more than, “with
my body I thee <i>honour</i>”, and so you may reply to
any fault-finder here.</p>

<p>Take another example of a very easy misapprehension,
although not now from Scripture or the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
Prayer Book, Fuller, our Church historian, having
occasion to speak of some famous divine that was
lately dead, exclaims, “Oh the <i>painfulness</i> of his
preaching!” If we did not know the former uses
of ‘painfulness’, we might take this for an exclamation
wrung out at the recollection of the tediousness
which he inflicted on his hearers. Far from
it; the words are a record not of the <i>pain</i> which
he caused to others, but of the <i>pains</i> which he
bestowed himself: and I am persuaded, if we had
more ‘painful’ preachers in the old sense of the
word, that is, who <i>took</i> pains themselves, we should
have fewer ‘painful’ ones in the modern sense,
who <i>cause</i> pain to their hearers. So too Bishop
Grosthead is recorded as “the <i>painful</i> writer of
two hundred books”&mdash;not meaning hereby that
these books were painful in the reading, but that
he was laborious and painful in their composing.</p>

<p>Here is another easy misapprehension. Swift
wrote a pamphlet, or, as he called it, a <i>Letter to the
Lord Treasurer</i>, with this title, “A proposal for
correcting, improving, and <i>ascertaining</i> the English
Tongue”. Who that brought a knowledge
of present English, and no more, to this passage,
would doubt that “<i>ascertaining</i> the English
Tongue” meant arriving at a certain knowledge
of what it was? Swift, however, means something
quite different from this. “<i>To ascertain</i> the English
tongue” is not with him to arrive at a subjective
certainty in our own minds of what that
tongue is, but to give an objective certainty to
that tongue itself, so that henceforth it shall
not alter nor change. For even Swift himself,
with all his masculine sense, entertained a dream<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
of this kind, as is more fully declared in the work
itself<a name="FNanchor_205_205" id="FNanchor_205_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">‘<i>Treacle</i>’</div>

<p>In other places unacquaintance with the changes
in a word’s usage will not so much mislead as
leave you nearly or altogether at a loss in respect
of the intention of an author whom you may be
reading. It is evident that he has a meaning, but
what it is you are unable to divine, even though
all the words he employs are words in familiar
employment to the present day. For example,
the poet Waller is congratulating Charles the
Second on his return from exile, and is describing
the way in which all men, even those formerly
most hostile to him, were now seeking his favour,
and he writes:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Offenders now, the chiefest, do begin<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To strive for grace, and expiate their sin:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All winds blow fair that did the world embroil,<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Your vipers treacle yield</i>, and scorpions oil”.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Many a reader before now has felt, as I cannot
doubt, a moment’s perplexity at the now courtly
poet’s assertion that “<i>vipers treacle yield</i>”&mdash;who
yet has been too indolent, or who has not had the
opportunity, to search out what his meaning might
be. There is in fact allusion here to a curious
piece of legendary lore. ‘Treacle’, or ‘triacle’,
as Chaucer wrote it, was originally a Greek word,
and wrapped up in itself the once popular belief
(an anticipation, by the way, of homœopathy), that
a confection of the viper’s flesh was the most
potent antidote against the viper’s
bite<a name="FNanchor_206_206" id="FNanchor_206_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a>.
Waller<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
goes back to this the word’s old meaning, familiar
enough in his time, for Milton speaks of “the
sovran <i>treacle</i> of sound
doctrine”<a name="FNanchor_207_207" id="FNanchor_207_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a>, while “Venice
treacle”, or “viper wine”, as it sometimes was
called, was a common name for a supposed antidote
against all poisons; and he would imply that
regicides themselves began to be loyal, vipers not
now yielding hurt any more, but rather healing
for the old hurts which they themselves had
inflicted. To trace the word down to its present
use, it may be observed that, designating first
this antidote, it then came to designate any
antidote, then any medicinal confection or sweet
syrup; and lastly that particular syrup, namely,
the sweet syrup of molasses, to which alone it is
now restricted.</p>

<div class="sidenote">‘<i>Blackguard</i>’</div>

<p>I will draw on the writings of Fuller for one
more example. In his <i>Holy War</i>, having enumerated
the rabble rout of fugitive debtors, runaway
slaves, thieves, adulterers, murderers, of men
laden for one cause or another with heaviest censures
of the Church, who swelled the ranks, and
helped to make up the army, of the Crusaders,
he exclaimed, “A lamentable case that the
devil’s <i>black guard</i> should be God’s soldiers”!
What does he mean, we may ask, by “the devil’s<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
<i>black guard</i>”? Nor is this a solitary mention of the
“black guard”. On the contrary, the phrase is
of very frequent recurrence in the early dramatists
and others down to the time of Dryden,
who gives as one of his stage directions in <i>Don
Sebastian</i>, “Enter the captain of the rabble, with
the <i>Black guard</i>”. What is this “black guard”?
Has it any connexion with a word of our homeliest
vernacular? We feel that probably it has so;
yet at first sight the connexion is not very apparent,
nor indeed the exact force of the phrase.
Let me trace its history. In old times, the palaces
of our kings and seats of our nobles were not so
well and completely furnished as at the present
day: and thus it was customary, when a royal
progress was made, or when the great nobility
exchanged one residence for another, that at such
a removal all kitchen utensils, pots and pans, and
even coals, should be also carried with them
where they went. Those who accompanied and
escorted these, the lowest, meanest, and dirtiest
of the retainers, were called ‘the black guard’<a name="FNanchor_208_208" id="FNanchor_208_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a>;
then any troop or company of ragamuffins; and
lastly, when the origin of the word was lost sight
of, and it was forgotten that it properly implied
a company, a rabble rout, and not a single person,
one would compliment another, not as belonging
to, but as himself being, the ‘blackguard’.</p>

<p>The examples which I have adduced are, I am
persuaded, sufficient to prove that it is not a use<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>less
and unprofitable study, nor yet one altogether
without entertainment, to which I invite you;
that on the contrary any one who desires to read
with accuracy, and thus with advantage and
pleasure, our earlier classics, who would avoid
continual misapprehension in their
<ins class="correction" title="original reads ‘persual’">perusal</ins>, and
would not often fall short of, and often go astray
from, their meaning, must needs bestow some
attention on the altered significance of English
words. And if this is so, we could not more
usefully employ what remains of this present
lecture than in seeking to indicate those changes
which words most frequently undergo; and to
trace as far as we can the causes, mental and
moral, at work in the minds of men to bring these
changes about, with the good and evil out of
which they have sprung, and to which they bear
witness.</p>

<p>For indeed these changes to which words in
the progress of time are submitted are not changes
at random, but for the most part are obedient to
certain laws, are capable of being distributed into
certain classes, being the outward transcripts and
witnesses of mental and moral processes inwardly
going forward in those who bring them about.
Many, it is true, will escape any classification of
ours, the changes which have taken place in their
meaning being, or at least seeming to us, the
result of mere caprice; and not explicable by any
principle which we can appeal to as habitually at
work in the mind. But, admitting all this, a
majority will still remain which are reducible to
some law or other, and with these we will occupy
ourselves now.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">‘<i>Duke</i>’, ‘<i>Corpse</i>’, ‘<i>Weed</i>’</div>

<p>And first, the meaning of a word oftentimes
is gradually narrowed. It was once as a generic
name, embracing many as yet unnamed species
within itself, which all went by its common designation.
By and bye it is found convenient that
each of these should have its own more special
sign allotted to it<a name="FNanchor_209_209" id="FNanchor_209_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a>. It is here just as in some
newly enclosed country, where a single household
will at first loosely occupy a whole district; while,
as cultivation proceeds, this district is gradually
parcelled out among a dozen or twenty, and under
more accurate culture employs and sustains them
all. Thus, for example, all food was once called
‘meat’; it is so in our Bible, and ‘horse-meat’ for
fodder is still no unusual phrase; yet ‘meat’ is
now a name given only to flesh. Any little book
or writing was a ‘libel’ once; now only such a
one as is scurrilous and injurious. Any leader
was a ‘duke’ (dux); thus “<i>duke</i> Hannibal” (Sir
Thomas Eylot), “<i>duke</i> Brennus” (Holland),
“<i>duke</i> Theseus” (Shakespeare), “<i>duke</i> Amalek”,
with other ‘dukes’ (Gen. xxxvi.). Any journey,
by land as much as by sea, was a
<ins class="correction" title="comma instead of period (full stop) in original">‘voyage’.</ins>
‘Fairy’ was not a name restricted, as now, to the
<i>Gothic</i> mythology; thus “the <i>fairy</i> Egeria” (Sir
J. Harrington). A ‘corpse’ might be quite as well
living as dead<a name="FNanchor_210_210" id="FNanchor_210_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a>. ‘Weeds’ were whatever covered
the earth or the person; while now as respects<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
the earth, those only are ‘weeds’ which are
noxious, or at least self-sown; as regards the
person, we speak of no other ‘weeds’ but the
widow’s<a name="FNanchor_211_211" id="FNanchor_211_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a>. In each of these cases, the same contraction
of meaning, the separating off and assigning
to other words of large portions of this, has
found place. ‘To starve’ (the German ‘sterben’,
and generally spelt ‘sterve’ up to the middle of
the seventeenth century), meant once to die any
manner of death; thus Chaucer says, Christ “<i>sterved</i>
upon the cross for our redemption”; it now is
restricted to the dying by cold or by hunger.
Words not a few were once applied to both sexes
alike, which are now restricted to the female.
It is so even with ‘girl’, which was once a young
person of either sex<a name="FNanchor_212_212" id="FNanchor_212_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a>; while other words in this
list, such for instance as ‘hoyden’<a name="FNanchor_213_213" id="FNanchor_213_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a> (Milton, prose),
‘shrew’ (Chaucer), ‘coquet’ (Phillips, <i>New World
of Words</i>), ‘witch’ (Wiclif), ‘termagant’ (Bale),
‘scold’, ‘jade’, ‘slut’ (Gower), must be regarded
in their present exclusive appropriation to the
female sex as evidences of men’s rudeness, and
not of women’s deserts.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Words used more accurately</i></div>

<p>The necessities of an advancing civilization<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
demand a greater precision and accuracy in the
use of words having to do with weight, measure,
number, size. Almost all such words as ‘acre’,
‘furlong’, ‘yard’, ‘gallon’, ‘peck’, were once of a
vague and unsettled use, and only at a later day,
and in obedience to the requirements of commerce
and social life, exact measures and designations.
Thus every field was once an ‘acre’; and this
remains so still with the German ‘acker’, and in
our “God’s acre”, as a name for a churchyard<a name="FNanchor_214_214" id="FNanchor_214_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a>;
it was not till about the reign of Edward the First
that ‘acre’ was commonly restricted to a determined
measure and portion of land. Here and
there even now a glebeland will be called “the
acre”; and this, even while it contains not one
but many of our measured acres. A ‘furlong’
was a ‘furrowlong’, or length of a furrow<a name="FNanchor_215_215" id="FNanchor_215_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a>.
Any pole was a ‘yard’, and this vaguer use survives
in ‘sail<i>yard</i>’, ‘hal<i>yard</i>’, and in other sea-terms.
Every pitcher was a ‘galon’ (Mark xiv. 13,
Wiclif), while a ‘peck’ was no more than a ‘poke’
or bag<a name="FNanchor_216_216" id="FNanchor_216_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a>. And the same has no doubt taken place
in all other languages. I will only remind you
how the Greek ‘drachm’ was at first a handful
(<span title="Greek: drachmê">δραχμή</span> = ‘manipulus’, from
<span title="Greek: drassô">δράσσω</span>, to
grasp);<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
its later word for ‘ten thousand’
(<span title="Greek: myrioi">μύριοι</span>) implied
in Homer’s time any great multitude; and with
the accent on a different syllable always retained
this meaning.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Words used less accurately</i></div>

<p>Opposite to this is a counter-process by which
words of narrower intention gradually enlarge the
domain of their meaning, becoming capable of
much wider application than any which once they
admitted. Instances in this kind are fewer than
in that which we have just been considering. The
main stream and course of human thoughts and
human discourse tends the other way, to discerning,
distinguishing, dividing; and then to the permanent
fixing of the distinctions gained, by the
aid of designations which shall keep apart for ever
in word that which has been once severed and sundered
in thought. Nor is it hard to perceive why
this process should be the more frequent. Men
are first struck with the likenesses between those
things which are presented to them, with their
points of resemblance; on the strength of which
they bracket them under a common term. Further
acquaintance reveals their points of unlikeness,
the real dissimilarities which lurk under superficial
resemblances, the need therefore of a different
notation for objects which are essentially different.
It is comparatively much rarer to discover real
likeness under what at first appeared as unlikeness;
and usually when a word moves forward, and from
a specialty indicates now a generality, it is not in
obedience to any such discovery of the true inner
likeness of things,&mdash;the steps of successful generalizations
being marked and secured in other
ways. But this widening of a word’s meaning is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
too often a result of those elements of disorganization
and decay which are at work in a language.
Men forget a word’s history and etymology; its
distinctive features are obliterated for them, with
all which attached it to some thought or fact which
by right was its own. Appropriated and restricted
once to some striking specialty which it vigorously
set out, it can now be used in a wider, vaguer,
more unsettled way. It can be employed twenty
times for once when it would have been possible
formerly to employ it. Yet this is not gain, but
pure loss. It has lost its place in the disciplined
<i>army</i> of words, and become one of a loose and
disorderly <i>mob</i>.</p>

<p>Let me instance the word ‘preposterous’. It is
now no longer of any practical service at all in the
language, being merely an ungraceful and slipshod
synonym for absurd. But restore and confine it to
its old use; let it designate that one peculiar
branch of absurdity which it designated once,
namely the reversing of the true order of things,
the putting of the last first, and, by consequence, of
the first last, and of what excellent service the
word would be capable. Thus it is ‘preposterous’,
in the most accurate use of the word, to put the cart
before the horse, to expect wages before the work is
done, to hang a man first and try him afterwards;
and in this strict and accurate sense the word was
always used by our elder writers<a name="FNanchor_217_217" id="FNanchor_217_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a>.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span></p>

<p>In like manner ‘to prevaricate’ was never
employed by good writers of the seventeenth
century without nearer or more remote allusion
to the uses of the word in the Roman law courts,
where a ‘prævaricator’ (properly a straddler with
distorted legs) did not mean generally and loosely,
as now with us, one who shuffles, quibbles, and
evades; but one who plays false in a particular
manner; who, undertaking, or being by his office
bound, to prosecute a charge, is in secret collusion
with the opposite party; and, betraying the cause
which he affects to support, so manages the accusation
as to obtain not the condemnation, but the
acquittal, of the accused; a “feint pleader”, as,
I think, in our old law language he would have
been termed. How much force would the keeping
of this in mind add to many passages in our
elder divines.</p>

<p>Or take ‘equivocal’, ‘equivocate’, ‘equivocation’.
These words, which belonged at first to
logic, have slipped down into common use, and in
so doing have lost all the precision of their first
employment. ‘Equivocation’ is now almost any
such dealing in ambiguous words with the intention
of deceiving, as falls short of an actual lie;
but according to its etymology and in its primary
use ‘equivocation’, this fruitful mother of so much
error, is the calling by the same name, of things
essentially diverse, hiding intentionally or otherwise
a real difference under a verbal
resemblance<a name="FNanchor_218_218" id="FNanchor_218_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a>.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
Nor let it be urged in defence of its present looser
use, that only so could it have served the needs
of our ordinary conversation; on the contrary,
had it retained its first use, how serviceable an
implement of thought would it have been in detecting
our own fallacies, or those of others; all which
it can be now no longer.</p>

<div class="sidenote">‘<i>Idea</i>’</div>

<p>What now is ‘idea’ for us? How infinite the
fall of this word since the time when Milton sang
of the Creator contemplating his newly created
world,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i10">“how it showed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Answering his great <i>idea</i>”,<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>to its present use when this person “has an <i>idea</i>
that the train has started”, and the other “had
no <i>idea</i> that the dinner would be so bad”. But
this word ‘idea’ is perhaps the worst case in the
English language. Matters have not mended
here since the times of Dr. Johnson; of whom
Boswell tells us: “He was particularly indignant
against the almost universal use of the word <i>idea</i>
in the sense of <i>notion</i> or <i>opinion</i>, when it is clear
that <i>idea</i> can only signify something of which an
image can be formed in the mind”. There is
perhaps no word in the whole compass of English,
so seldom used with any tolerable correctness;
in none is the distance so immense between the
frequent sublimity of the word in its proper use,
and the triviality of it in its slovenly and its
popular.</p>

<p>This tendency in words to lose the sharp, rigidly
defined outline of meaning which they once possessed,
to become of wide, vague, loose application
instead of fixed, definite, and precise, to mean<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
almost anything, and so really to mean nothing,
is among the most fatally effectual which are at
work for the final ruin of a language, and, I do not
fear to add, for the demoralization of those that
speak it. It is one against which we shall all do
well to watch; for there is none of us who cannot
do something in keeping words close to their own
proper meaning, and in resisting their encroachment
on the domain of others.</p>

<p>The causes which bring this mischief about are
not hard to trace. We all know that when a
piece of our silver money has long fulfilled its
part, as “pale and common drudge ’tween man and
man”, whatever it had at first of sharper outline
and livelier impress is in the end wholly obliterated
from it. So it is with words, above all with words
of science and theology. These getting into general
use, and passing often from mouth to mouth, lose
the “image and superscription” which they had,
before they descended from the school to the
market-place, from the pulpit to the street. Being
now caught up by those who understand imperfectly
and thus incorrectly their true value,
who will not be at the pains of understanding
that, or who are incapable of doing so, they are
obliged to accommodate themselves to the lower
sphere in which they circulate, by laying aside
much of the precision and accuracy and depth
which once they had; they become weaker, shallower,
more indefinite; till in the end, as exponents
of thought and feeling, they cease to be of
any service at all.</p>

<hr class="small" />

<div class="sidenote">‘<i>Bombast</i>’, ‘<i>Garble</i>’</div>

<p>Sometimes a word does not merely narrow or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
extend its meaning, but altogether changes it;
and this it does in more ways than one. Thus a
secondary figurative sense will quite put out of
use and extinguish the literal, until in the entire
predominance of that it is altogether forgotten
that it ever possessed any other. I may instance
‘bombast’ as a word about which this forgetfulness
is nearly complete. What ‘bombast’ now
means is familiar to us all, namely inflated words,
“full of sound and fury”, but “signifying nothing”.
This, at present its sole meaning, was once
only the secondary and superinduced; ‘bombast’
being properly the cotton plant, and then the cotton
wadding with which garments were stuffed out
and lined. You remember perhaps how Prince
Hal addresses Falstaff, “How now, my sweet
creature of <i>bombast</i>”; using the word in its literal
sense; and another early poet has this line:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Thy body’s bolstered out with <i>bombast</i> and with bags”.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>‘Bombast’ was then transferred in a vigorous
image to the big words without strength or solidity
wherewith the discourses of some were stuffed
out, and has now quite forgone any other meaning.
So too ‘to garble’ was once “to cleanse
from dross and dirt, as grocers do their spices, to
pick or cull out”<a name="FNanchor_219_219" id="FNanchor_219_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a>. It is never used now in this
its primary sense, and has indeed undergone this
further change, that while once ‘to garble’ was to
sift for the purpose of selecting the best, it is now<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
to sift with a view of picking out the worst<a name="FNanchor_220_220" id="FNanchor_220_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a>.
‘Polite’ is another word which in the figurative
sense has quite extinguished the literal. We still
speak of ‘polished’ surfaces; but not any more,
with Cudworth, of “<i>polite</i> bodies, as looking
glasses”. Neither do we now ‘exonerate’ a ship
(Burton); nor ‘stigmatize’, at least otherwise
than figuratively, a ‘malefactor’ (the same); nor
‘corroborate’ our health (Sir Thomas Elyot).</p>

<p>Again, a word will travel on by slow and regularly
progressive courses of change, itself a faithful
index of changes going on in society and in the
minds of men, till at length everything is changed
about it. The process of this it is often very
curious to observe; capable as not seldom it is of
being watched step by step in its advances to the
final consummation. There may be said to be
three leading phases which the word successively
presents, three steps in its history. At first it
grows naturally out of its own root, is filled with
its own natural meaning. Presently the word
allows another meaning, one superinduced on the
former, and foreign to its etymology, to share
with the other in the possession of it, on the
ground that where the former exists, the latter
commonly co-exists with it. At the third step,
the newly introduced meaning, not satisfied with
its moiety, with dividing the possession of the
word, has thrust out the original and rightful possessor
altogether, and remains in sole and exclu<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>sive
possession. The three successive stages may
be represented by <i>a</i>, <i>ab</i>, <i>b</i>; in which series <i>b</i>,
which was wanting altogether at the first stage,
and was only admitted as secondary at the second,
does at the third become primary and indeed
alone.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Gradual Change of Meaning</i></div>

<p>We are not to suppose that in actual fact the
transitions from one signification to another are so
strongly and distinctly marked, as I have found it
convenient to mark them here. Indeed it is hard
to imagine anything more gradual, more subtle and
imperceptible, than the process of change. The
manner in which the new meaning first insinuates
itself into the old, and then drives out the old, can
only be compared to the process of petrifaction, as
rightly understood&mdash;the water not gradually turning
what is put into it to stone, as we generally
take the operation to be; but successively displacing
each several particle of that which is
brought within its power, and depositing a stony
particle, in its stead, till, in the end, while all
appears to continue the same, all has in fact been
thoroughly changed. It is precisely thus, by such
slow, gradual, and subtle advances that the new
meaning filters through and pervades the word,
little by little displacing entirely that which it
before possessed.</p>

<p>No word would illustrate this process better than
that old example, familiar probably to us all, of
‘villain’. The ‘villain’ is, first, the serf or peasant,
‘villanus’, because attached to the ‘villa’ or
farm. He is, secondly, the peasant who, it is
further taken for granted, will be churlish, selfish,
dishonest, and generally of evil moral conditions,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
these having come to be assumed as always belonging
to him, and to be permanently associated
with his name, by those higher classes of society
who in the main commanded the springs of language.
At the third step, nothing of the meaning
which the etymology suggests, nothing of
‘villa’, survives any longer; the peasant is wholly
dismissed, and the evil moral conditions of him
who is called by this name alone remain; so that
the name would now in this its final stage be applied
as freely to peer, if he deserved it, as to
peasant. ‘Boor’ has had exactly the same history;
being first the cultivator of the soil; then
secondly, the cultivator of the soil who, it is assumed,
will be coarse, rude, and unmannerly;
and then thirdly, any one who is coarse, rude, and
unmannerly<a name="FNanchor_221_221" id="FNanchor_221_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a>. So too ‘pagan’; which is first villager,
then heathen villager, and lastly heathen.
You may trace the same progress in ‘churl’,
‘clown’, ‘antic’, and in numerous other words.
The intrusive meaning might be likened in all
these cases to the egg which the cuckoo lays in the
sparrow’s nest; the young cuckoo first sharing
the nest with its rightful occupants, but not resting
till it has dislodged and ousted them altogether.</p>

<div class="sidenote">‘<i>Gossip</i>’</div>

<p>I will illustrate by the aid of one word more
this part of my subject. I called your attention
in my last lecture to the true character of several
words and forms in use among our country people,
and claimed for them to be in many instances<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
genuine English, though English now more or
less antiquated and overlived. ‘Gossip’ is a word
in point. I have myself heard this name given
by our Hampshire peasantry to the sponsors in
baptism, the godfathers and godmothers. I do
not say that it is a usual word; but it is occasionally
employed, and well understood. This is
a perfectly correct employment of ‘gossip’, in fact
its proper and original one, and involves moreover
a very curious record of past beliefs. ‘Gossip’,
or ‘gossib’, as Chaucer spelt it, is a compound
word, made up of the name of ‘God’, and of an old
Anglo-Saxon word, ‘sib’, still alive in Scotland, as
all readers of Walter Scott will remember, and in
some parts of England, and which means, akin;
they were said to be ‘sib’, who are related to one
another. But why, you may ask, was the name
given to sponsors? Out of this reason;&mdash;in the
middle ages it was the prevailing belief (and the
Romish Church still affirms it), that those who
stood as sponsors to the same child, besides contracting
spiritual obligations on behalf of that child,
also contracted spiritual affinity one with another;
they became <i>sib</i>, or akin, in <i>God</i>; and thus ‘gossips’;
hence ‘gossipred’, an old word, exactly
analogous to ‘kindred’. Out of this faith the
Roman Catholic Church will not allow (unless
indeed by dispensations procured for money),
those who have stood as sponsors to the same
child, afterwards to contract marriage with one
another, affirming them too nearly related for this
to be lawful.</p>

<p>Take ‘gossip’ however in its ordinary present
use, as one addicted to idle tittle-tattle, and it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
seems to bear no relation whatever to its etymology
and first meaning. The same three steps, however,
which we have traced before will bring us to
its present use. ‘Gossips’ are, first, the sponsors,
brought by the act of a common sponsorship into
affinity and near familiarity with one another;
secondly, these sponsors, who being thus brought
together, allow themselves one with the other in
familiar, and then in trivial and idle talk; thirdly,
any who allow themselves in this trivial and idle
talk,&mdash;called in French ‘commérage’, from the
fact that ‘commére’ has run through exactly the
same stages as its English equivalent.</p>

<p>It is plain that words which designate not things
and persons only, but these as they are contemplated
more or less in an ethical light, words which
tinge with a moral sentiment what they designate,
are peculiarly exposed to change; are constantly
liable to take a new colouring, or to lose an old.
The gauge and measure of praise or blame, honour
or dishonour, admiration or abhorrence, which they
convey, is so purely a mental and subjective one,
that it is most difficult to take accurate note of
its rise or of its fall, while yet there are causes
continually at work leading it to the one or the
other. There are words not a few, but ethical
words above all, which have so imperceptibly
drifted away from their former moorings, that
although their position is now very different from
that which they once occupied, scarcely one in a
hundred of casual readers, whose attention has
not been specially called to the subject, will have
observed that they have moved at all. Here too
we observe some words conveying less of praise<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
or blame than once, and some more; while some
have wholly shifted from the one to the other.
Some were at one time words of slight, almost of
offence, which have altogether ceased to be so
now. Still these are rare by comparison with
those which once were harmless, but now are
harmless no more; which once, it may be, were
terms of honour, but which now imply a slight or
even a scorn. It is only too easy to perceive
why these should exceed those in number.</p>

<div class="sidenote">‘<i>Imp</i>’, ‘<i>Brat</i>’</div>

<p>Let us take an example or two. If any were
to speak now of royal children as “royal <i>imps</i>”,
it would sound, and with our present use of the
word would be, impertinent and unbecoming
enough; and yet ‘imp’ was once a name of dignity
and honour, and not of slight or of undue
familiarity. Thus Spenser addresses the Muses
in this language,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Ye sacred <i>imps</i> that on Parnasso dwell”;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>and ‘imp’ was especially used of the scions of
royal or illustrious houses. More than one epitaph,
still existing, of our ancient nobility might
be quoted, beginning in such language as this,
“Here lies that noble <i>imp</i>”. Or what should we
say of a poet who commenced a solemn poem in
this fashion,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Oh Israel, oh household of the Lord,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh Abraham’s <i>brats</i>, oh brood of blessed seed”?<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Could we conclude anything else but that he meant,
by using low words on lofty occasions, to turn
sacred things into ridicule? Yet this was very
far from the intention of Gascoigne, the poet
whose lines I have just quoted. “Abraham’s<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
<i>brats</i>” was used by him in perfect good faith, and
without the slightest feeling that anything ludicrous
or contemptuous adhered to the word
‘brat’, as indeed in his time there did not, any
more than adheres to ‘brood’, which is another
form of the same word now<a name="FNanchor_222_222" id="FNanchor_222_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a>.</p>

<p>Call a person ‘pragmatical’, and you now imply
not merely that he is busy, but <i>over</i>-busy,
officious, self-important, and pompous to boot.
But it once meant nothing of the kind, and ‘pragmatical’
(like <span title="Greek: pragmatikos">πραγματικός</span>) was one engaged
in affairs, being an honourable title, given to a
man simply and industriously accomplishing
the business which properly concerned him<a name="FNanchor_223_223" id="FNanchor_223_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a>.
So too to say that a person ‘meddles’ or is a
‘meddler’ implies now that he interferes unduly
in other men’s matters, without a call mixing himself
up with them. This was not insinuated in
the earlier uses of the word. On the contrary
three of our earlier translations of the Bible have,
“<i>Meddle</i> with your own business” (1 Thess. iv.
11); and Barrow in one of his sermons draws at
some length the distinction between ‘meddling’
and “being <i>meddlesome</i>”, and only condemns
the latter.</p>

<div class="sidenote">‘<i>Proser</i>’</div>

<p>Or take again the words, ‘to prose’ or a ‘proser’.
It cannot indeed be affirmed that they convey
any <i>moral</i> condemnation, yet they certainly con<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>vey
no compliment now; and are almost among
the last which any one would desire should with
justice be applied either to his talking or his
writing. For ‘to prose’, as we all now know too
well, is to talk or write heavily and tediously,
without spirit and without animation; but once
it was simply the antithesis of to versify, and
a ‘proser’ the antithesis of a versifier or a poet.
It will follow that the most rapid and liveliest
writer who ever wrote, if he did not write in verse
would have ‘prosed’ and been a ‘proser’, in
the language of our ancestors. Thus Drayton
writes of his contemporary Nashe:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“And surely Nashe, though he a <i>proser</i> were,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">A branch of laurel yet deserves to bear”;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>that is, the ornament not of a ‘proser’, but of a
poet. The tacit assumption that vigour, animation,
rapid movement, with all the precipitation
of the spirit, belong to verse rather than to prose,
and are the exclusive possession of it, is that
which must explain the changed uses of the word.</p>

<div class="sidenote">‘<i>Knave</i>’</div>

<p>Still it is according to a word’s present signification
that we must apply it now. It would be
no excuse, having applied an insulting epithet to
any, if we should afterwards plead that, tried by
its etymology and primary usage, it had nothing
offensive or insulting about it; although indeed
Swift assures us that in his time such a plea was
made and was allowed. “I remember”, he says,
“at a trial in Kent, where Sir George Rooke was
indicted for calling a gentleman ‘knave’ and
‘villain’, the lawyer for the defendant brought off
his client by alleging that the words were not
injurious; for ‘knave’ in the old and true signi<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>fication
imported only a servant<a name="FNanchor_224_224" id="FNanchor_224_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a>; and ‘villain’
in Latin is villicus, which is no more than a man
employed in country labour, or rather a baily”.
The lawyer may have deserved his success for
his ingenuity and his boldness; though, if Swift
reports him aright, not certainly on the ground
of the strict accuracy either of his Anglo-Saxon
or his Latin.</p>

<p>The moral sense and conviction of men is often
at work upon their words, giving them new turns
in obedience to these convictions, of which their
changed use will then remain a permanent record.
Let me illustrate this by the history of our word
‘sycophant’. You probably are acquainted with
the story which the Greek scholiasts invented by
way of explaining a word of which they knew
nothing, namely that the ‘sycophant’ was a
“manifester of figs”, one who detected others in
the act of exporting figs from Attica, an act forbidden,
they asserted, by the Athenian law; and
accused them to the people. Be this explanation
worth what it may, the word obtained in Greek
a more general sense; any accuser, and then any
<i>false</i> accuser, was a ‘sycophant’; and when the
word was first adopted into the English language,
it was in this meaning: thus an old English poet
speaks of “the railing route of <i>sycophants</i>”;
and Holland: “The poor man that hath nought
to lose, is not afraid of the <i>sycophant</i>”. But it
has not kept this meaning; a ‘sycophant’ is
now a fawning flatterer; not one who speaks
ill of you behind your back; rather one who
speaks good of you before your face, but good<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
which he does not in his heart believe. Yet how
true a moral instinct has presided over the changed
signification of the word. The calumniator
and the flatterer, although they seem so opposed
to one another, how closely united they really
are. They grow out of the same root. The
same baseness of spirit which shall lead one to
speak evil of you behind your back, will lead him
to fawn on you and flatter you before your face;
there is a profound sense in that Italian proverb,
“Who flatters me before, spatters me behind”.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Weakening of Words</i></div>

<p>But it is not the moral sense only of men which
is thus at work, modifying their words; but
the immoral as well. If the good which men
have and feel, penetrates into their speech, and
leaves its deposit there, so does also the evil.
Thus we may trace a constant tendency&mdash;in too
many cases it has been a successful one&mdash;to empty
words employed in the condemnation of evil,
of the depth and earnestness of the moral reprobation
which they once conveyed. Men’s too
easy toleration of sin, the feebleness of their
moral indignation against it, brings about that
the blame which words expressed once, has in
some of them become much weaker now than once,
has from others vanished altogether. “To do a
<i>shrewd</i> turn”, was once to do a <i>wicked</i> turn;
and Chaucer, using ‘shrewdness’ by which to
translate the Latin ‘improbitas’, shows that it
meant wickedness for him; nay, two murderers
he calls two ‘shrews’,&mdash;for there were, as already
noticed, male shrews once as well as female.
But “a <i>shrewd</i> turn” now, while it implies a certain
amount of sharp dealing, yet implies nothing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
more; and ‘shrewdness’ is applied to men rather
in their praise than in their dispraise. And not
‘shrewd’ and ‘shrewdness’ only, but a multitude
of other words,&mdash;I will only instance ‘prank’
‘flirt’, ‘luxury’, ‘luxurious’, ‘peevish’, ‘wayward’,
‘loiterer’, ‘uncivil’,&mdash;conveyed once a
much more earnest moral disapproval than now
they do.</p>

<p>But I must bring this lecture to a close. I
have but opened to you paths, which you, if you
are so minded, can follow up for yourselves. We
have learned lately to speak of men’s
‘antecedents’<a name="FNanchor_225_225" id="FNanchor_225_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a>;
the phrase is newly come up; and it
is common to say that if we would know what
a man really now is, we must know his ‘antecedents’,
that is, what he has been in time past.
This is quite as true about words. If we would
know what they now are, we must know what
they have been; we must know, if possible, the
date and place of their birth, the successive stages
of their subsequent history, the company which
they have kept, all the road which they have
travelled, and what has brought them to the point
at which now we find them; we must know, in
short, their antecedents.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Changes of Meaning</i></div>

<p>And let me say, without attempting to bring
back school into these lectures which are out of
school, that, seeking to do this, we might add an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
interest to our researches in the lexicon and the
dictionary which otherwise they could never have;
that taking such words, for example, as
<span title="Greek: ekklêsia">ἐκκλησία</span>,
or <span title="Greek: palingenesia">παλιγγενεσία</span>, or
<span title="Greek: eutrapelia">εὐτραπελία</span>, or
<span title="Greek: sophistês">σοφιστής</span>, or
<span title="Greek: scholastikos">σχολαστικός</span>, in Greek;
as ‘religio’, or ‘sacramentum’,
or ‘urbanitas’, or ‘superstitio’, in
Latin; as ‘libertine’, or
‘casuistry’<a name="FNanchor_226_226" id="FNanchor_226_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a>, or ‘humanity’,
or ‘humorous’, or ‘danger’, or ‘romance’,
in English, and endeavouring to trace the manner
in which one meaning grew out of and superseded
another, and how they arrived at that use in
which they have finally rested (if indeed before
our English words there is not a future still), we
shall derive, I believe, amusement, I am sure,
instruction; we shall feel that we are really getting
something, increasing the moral and intellectual
stores of our minds; furnishing ourselves
with that which may hereafter be of service to
ourselves, may be of service to others&mdash;than
which there can be no feeling more pleasurable,
none more delightful. I shall be glad and
thankful, if you can feel as much in regard of
that lecture, which I now bring to its
end<a name="FNanchor_227_227" id="FNanchor_227_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a>.</p>

<h3>CHANGES IN THE SPELLING OF ENGLISH WORDS</h3>


<p>When I announce to you that the subject of my
lecture to-day will be English orthography, or
the spelling of the words in our native language,
with the alterations which this has undergone,
you may perhaps think with yourselves that a
weightier, or, if not a weightier, at all events a
more interesting subject might have occupied
this our concluding lecture. I cannot admit it to
be wanting either in importance or in interest.
Unimportant it certainly is not, but might well
engage, as it often has engaged, the attention of
those with far higher acquirements than any
which I possess. Uninteresting it may be, by
faults in the manner of treating it; but I am sure
it ought as little to be this; and would never
prove so in competent hands<a name="FNanchor_228_228" id="FNanchor_228_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a>. Let us then
address ourselves to this matter, not without
good hope that it may yield us both profit and
pleasure.</p>

<p>I know not who it was that said, “The inven<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>tion
of printing was very well; but, as compared
to the invention of writing, it was no such great
matter after all”. Whoever it was who made
this observation, it is clear that for him use and
familiarity had not obliterated the wonder which
there is in that, whereat we probably have long
ceased to wonder at all&mdash;the power, namely, of
representing sounds by written signs, of reproducing
for the eye that which existed at first only
for the ear: nor was the estimate which he formed
of the relative value of these two inventions other
than a just one. Writing indeed stands more
nearly on a level with speaking, and deserves
rather to be compared with it, than with printing;
which, with all its utility, is yet of altogether
another and inferior type of greatness: or, if
this is too much to claim for writing, it may at
any rate be affirmed to stand midway between
the other two, and to be as much superior to the
one as it is inferior to the other.</p>

<p>The intention of the written word, that which
presides at its first formation, the end whereunto
it is a mean, is by aid of symbols agreed on
beforehand, to represent to the eye with as much
accuracy as possible the spoken word.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Imperfection of Writing</i></div>

<p>It never fulfils this intention completely, and
by degrees more and more imperfectly. Short as
man’s spoken word often falls of his thought, his
written word falls often as short of his spoken.
Several causes contribute to this. In the first
place, the marks of imperfection and infirmity
cleave to writing, as to every other invention of
man. All alphabets have been left incomplete.
They have superfluous letters, letters, that is,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
which they do not want, because other letters
already represent the sound which they represent;
they have dubious letters, letters, that is, which
say nothing certain about the sounds they stand
for, because more than one sound is represented
by them&mdash;our ‘c’ for instance, which sometimes
has the sound of ‘s’, as in ‘<i>c</i>ity’, sometimes of
‘k’, as in ‘<i>c</i>at’; they are deficient in letters,
that is, the language has elementary sounds which
have no corresponding letters appropriated to
them, and can only be represented by combinations
of letters. All alphabets, I believe, have some
of these faults, not a few of them have all, and more.
This then is one reason of the imperfect reproduction
of the spoken word by the written. But
another is, that the human voice is so wonderfully
fine and flexible an organ, is able to mark
such subtle and delicate distinctions of sound, so
infinitely to modify and vary these sounds, that
were an alphabet complete as human art could
make it, did it possess eight and forty instead of
four and twenty letters, there would still remain
a multitude of sounds which it could only approximately
give back<a name="FNanchor_229_229" id="FNanchor_229_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Alphabets Inadequate</i></div>

<p>But there is a further cause for the divergence
which comes gradually to find place between men’s
spoken and their written words. What men
do often, they will seek to do with the least possible
trouble. There is nothing which they do
oftener than repeat words; they will seek here
then to save themselves pains; they will contract<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
two or more syllables into one; (‘toto opere’
will become ‘topper’; ‘vuestra merced’, ‘usted’;
and ‘topside the other way’, ‘topsy-turvey’<a name="FNanchor_230_230" id="FNanchor_230_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a>);
they will slur over, and thus after a while cease
to pronounce, certain letters; for hard letters
they will substitute soft; for those which require
a certain effort to pronounce, they will substitute
those which require little or none. Under the
operation of these causes a gulf between the
written and spoken word will not merely exist;
but it will have the tendency to grow ever wider
and wider. This tendency indeed will be partially
counterworked by approximations which from
time to time will by silent consent be made of the
written word to the spoken; here and there a
letter dropped in speech will be dropped also in
writing, as the ‘s’ in so many French words,
where its absence is marked by a circumflex; a
new shape, contracted or briefer, which a word has
taken on the lips of men, will find its representation
in their writing; as ‘chirurgeon’ will not
merely be pronounced, but also spelt, ‘surgeon’,
and ‘synodsman’ ‘sidesman’. Still for all this,
and despite of these partial readjustments of the
relations between the two, the anomalies will be
infinite; there will be a multitude of written
letters which have ceased to be sounded letters;
a multitude of words will exist in one shape upon
our lips, and in quite another in our books.</p>

<p>It is inevitable that the question should arise<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>&mdash;Shall
these anomalies be meddled with? shall it
be attempted to remove them, and bring writing
and speech into harmony and consent&mdash;a harmony
and consent which never indeed in actual fact at
any period of the language existed, but which yet
may be regarded as the object of written speech,
as the idea which, however imperfectly realized,
has, in the reduction of spoken sounds to written,
floated before the minds of men? If the attempt
is to be made, it is clear that it can only be made
in one way. The alternative is not open, whether
Mahomet shall go to the mountain, <i>or</i> the mountain
to Mahomet. The spoken word is the mountain;
it will not stir; it will resist all interference. It
feels its own superior rights, that it existed
the first, that it is, so to say, the elder brother;
and it will never be induced to change itself for
the purpose of conforming and complying with the
written word. Men will not be persuaded to pronounce
‘wou<i>l</i>d’ and ‘de<i>b</i>t’, because they write
‘would’ and ‘debt’ severally with an ‘l’ and with
a ‘b’: but what if they could be induced to write
‘woud’ and ‘det’, because they pronounce so;
and to deal in like manner with all other words, in
which there exists at present a discrepancy between
the word as it is spoken, and the word as it is
written?</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Phonetic Systems</i></div>

<p>Here we have the explanation of that which in
the history of almost all literatures has repeated
itself more than once, namely, the endeavour to
introduce phonetic writing. It has certain plausibilities
to rest on; it has its appeal to the unquestionable
fact that the written word was intended
to picture to the eye what the spoken word sounded<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
in the ear. At the same time I believe that it
would be impossible to introduce it; and, even
if it <i>were</i> possible, that it would be most undesirable,
and this for two reasons; the first being
that the losses consequent upon its introduction,
would far outweigh the gains, even supposing those
gains as great as the advocates of the scheme promise;
the second, that these promised gains would
themselves be only very partially realized, or not
at all.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Alphabets Imperfect</i></div>

<p>In the first place, I believe it to be impossible.
It is clear that such a scheme must begin with
the reconstruction of the alphabet. The first
thing that the phonographers have perceived is
the necessity for the creation of a vast number of
new signs, the poverty of all existing alphabets,
at any rate of our own, not yielding a several sign
for all the several sounds in the language. Our
English phonographers have therefore had to
invent ten of these new signs or letters, which are
henceforth to take their place with our <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>, and
to enjoy equal rights with them. Rejecting two
(<i>q</i>, <i>x</i>), and adding ten, they have raised their alphabet
from twenty-six letters to thirty-four. But
to procure the reception of such a reconstructed
alphabet is simply an impossibility, as much an
impossibility as would be the reconstitution of
the structure of the language in any points where
it was manifestly deficient or illogical. Sciolists
or scholars may sit down in their studies, and devise
these new letters, and prove that we need them,
and that the introduction of them would be a great
gain, and a manifest improvement; and this
may be all very true; but if they think they can<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
induce a people to adopt them, they know little of
the ways in which its alphabet is entwined with
the whole innermost life of a people. One may
freely own that all present alphabets are redundant
here, are deficient there; our English perhaps
is as greatly at fault as any, and with that
we have chiefly to do. Unquestionably it has
more letters than one to express one and the same
sound; it has only one letter to express two or
three sounds; it has sounds which are only capable
of being expressed at all by awkward and roundabout
expedients. Yet at the same time we must
accept the fact, as we accept any other which it
is out of our power to change&mdash;with regret, indeed,
but with a perfect acquiescence: as one accepts
the fact that Ireland is not some thirty or forty
miles nearer to England&mdash;that it is so difficult to
get round Cape Horn&mdash;that the climate of Africa
is so fatal to European life. A people will no more
quit their alphabet than they will quit their language;
they will no more consent to modify the
one <i>ab extra</i> than the other. Cæsar avowed that
with all his power he could not introduce a new
word, and certainly Claudius could not introduce
a new letter. Centuries may sanction the bringing
in of a new one, or the dropping of an old.
But to imagine that it is possible to suddenly
introduce a group of ten new letters, as these
reformers propose&mdash;they might just as feasibly
propose that the English language should form
its comparatives and superlatives on some entirely
new scheme, say in Greek fashion, by the terminations
‘oteros’ and ‘otatos’; or that we should
agree to set up a dual; or that our substantives<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
should return to our Anglo-Saxon declensions.
Any one of these or like proposals would not
betray a whit more ignorance of the eternal laws
which regulate human language, and of the limits
within which deliberate action upon it is possible,
than does this of increasing our alphabet by ten
entirely novel signs.</p>

<p>But grant it possible, grant our six and twenty
letters to have so little sacredness in them that
Englishmen would endure a crowd of upstart
interlopers to mix themselves on an equal footing
with them, still this could only be from a sense of
the greatness of the advantage to be derived from
this introduction. Now the vast advantage
claimed by the advocates of the system is, that it
would facilitate the learning to read, and wholly
save the labour of learning to spell, which “on the
present plan occupies”, as they assure us, “at
the very lowest calculation from three to five
years”. Spelling, it is said, would no longer need
to be learned at all; since whoever knew the
sound, would necessarily know also the spelling,
this being in all cases in perfect conformity with
that. The anticipation of this gain rests upon two
assumptions which are tacitly taken for granted,
but both of them erroneous.</p>

<p>The first of these assumptions is, that all men
pronounce all words alike, so that whenever they
come to spell a word, they will exactly agree as to
what the outline of its sound is. Now we are sure
men will not do this from the fact that, before
there was any fixed and settled orthography in our
language, when therefore everybody was more or
less a phonographer, seeking to write down the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
word as it sounded to <i>him</i>, (for he had no other
law to guide him,) the variations of spelling were
infinite. Take for instance the word ‘sudden’;
which does not seem to promise any great scope
for variety. I have myself met with this word spelt
in the following fifteen ways among our early
writers: ‘sodain’, ‘sodaine’, ‘sodan’, ‘sodayne’,
‘sodden’, ‘sodein’, ‘sodeine’, ‘soden’, ‘sodeyn’,
‘suddain’, ‘suddaine’, ‘suddein’, ‘suddeine’,
‘sudden’, ‘sudeyn’. Again, in how many
ways was Raleigh’s name spelt, or Shakespeare’s?
The same is evident from the spelling
of uneducated persons in our own day. They
have no other rule but the sound to guide them.
How is it that they do not all spell alike; erroneously,
it may be, as having only the sound for their guide,
but still falling all into exactly the same errors?
What is the actual fact? They not merely spell
wrong, which might be laid to the charge of our
perverse system of spelling, but with an inexhaustible
diversity of error, and that too in the
case of simplest words. Thus the little town of
Woburn would seem to give small room for caprice
in spelling, while yet the postmaster there has
made, from the superscription of letters that have
passed through his hands, a collection of two
hundred and forty-four varieties of ways in which
the place has been spelt<a name="FNanchor_231_231" id="FNanchor_231_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a>. It may be replied that
these were all or nearly all from the letters of the
ignorant and uneducated. Exactly so;&mdash;but it is
for their sakes, and to place them on a level with
the educated, or rather to accelerate their education
by the omission of a useless yet troublesome dis<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>cipline,
that the change is proposed. I wish to
show you that after the change they would be just
as much, or almost as much, at a loss in their
spelling as now.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Pronouncing Dictionaries</i></div>

<p>And another reason which would make it quite
as necessary then to learn orthography as now, is
the following. Pronunciation, as I have already
noticed, is far too fine and subtle a thing to be
more than approximated to, and indicated in the
written letter. In a multitude of cases the difficulties
which pronunciation presented would be
sought to be overcome in different ways, and thus
different spelling, would arise; or if not so, one
would have to be arbitrarily selected, and would
have need to be learned, just as much as the
spelling of a word now has need to be learned. I
will only ask you, in proof of this which I affirm,
to turn to any Pronouncing Dictionary. That
greatest of all absurdities, a Pronouncing Dictionary,
may be of some service to you in this
matter; it will certainly be of none in any other.
When you mark the elaborate and yet ineffectual
artifices by which it toils after the finer distinctions
of articulation, seeks to reproduce in letters
what exists, and can only exist, as the spoken
tradition of pronunciation, acquired from lip to
lip by the organ of the ear, capable of being
learned, but incapable of being taught; or when
you compare two of these dictionaries with one
another, and mark the entirely different schemes
and combinations of letters which they employ for
representing the same sound to the eye; you
will then perceive how idle the attempt to make
the written in language commensurate with the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
sounded; you will own that not merely out of
human caprice, ignorance, or indolence, the former
falls short of and differs from the later; but that
this lies in the necessity of things, in the fact
that man’s <i>voice</i> can effect so much more than
ever his <i>letter</i>
can<a name="FNanchor_232_232" id="FNanchor_232_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a>.
You will then perceive that
there would be as much, or nearly as much, of
the <ins class="correction" title="original reads ‘arbitary’">arbitrary</ins>
in spelling which calls itself phonetic
as in our present, that spelling would have
to be learned just as really then as now. We
should be unable to dismiss the spelling card even
after the arrival of that great day, when, for example,
those lines of Pope which hitherto we have
thus spelt and read,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“But errs not nature from this gracious end,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">When earthquakes swallow, or when tempests sweep<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Towns to one grave, whole nations to the deep”?<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>when I say, instead of this they should present
themselves to our eyes in the following attractive
form:</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Losses of Phonetic Spelling</i></div>

<p>The scheme would not then fulfil its promises.
Its vaunted gains, when we come to look closely
at them, disappear. And now for its losses. There
are in every language a vast number of words,
which the ear does not distinguish from one
another, but which are at once distinguishable to
the eye by the spelling. I will only instance a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
few which are the same parts of speech; thus
‘sun’ and ‘son’; ‘virge’ (‘virga’, now obsolete)
and ‘verge’; ‘reign’, ‘rain’, and ‘rein’; ‘hair’ and
‘hare’; ‘plate’ and ‘plait’; ‘moat’ and ‘mote’;
‘pear’ and ‘pair’; ‘pain’ and ‘pane’; ‘raise’ and
‘raze’; ‘air’ and ‘heir’; ‘ark’ and ‘arc’; ‘mite’
and ‘might’; ‘pour’ and ‘pore’; ‘veil’ and ‘vale’;
‘knight’ and ‘night’; ‘knave’ and ‘nave’; ‘pier’
and ‘peer’; ‘rite’ and ‘right’; ‘site’ and ‘sight’;
‘aisle’ and ‘isle’; ‘concent’ and ‘consent’;
‘signet’ and ‘cygnet’. Now, of course, it is a real
disadvantage, and may be the cause of serious
confusion, that there should be words in spoken
languages of entirely different origin and meaning
which yet cannot in sound be differenced from one
another. The phonographers simply propose to
extend this disadvantage already cleaving to our
spoken languages, to the written languages as well.
It is fault enough in the French language, that
‘mère’ a mother, ‘mer’ the sea, ‘maire’ a mayor
of a town, should have no perceptible difference
between them in the spoken tongue; or again that
in some there should be nothing to distinguish
‘sans’, ‘sang’, ‘sent’, ‘sens’, ‘s’en’, ‘cent’; nor
yet between ‘ver’, ‘vert’, ‘verre’ and
<ins class="correction" title="comma instead of period (full stop) in original">‘vers’.</ins>
Surely it is not very wise to propose gratuitously to
extend the same fault to the written languages as
well.</p>

<p>This loss in so many instances of the power to
discriminate between words, which however liable
to confusion now in our spoken language, are
liable to none in our written, would be serious
enough; but far more serious than this would be
the loss which would constantly ensue, of all which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
visibly connects a word with the past, which tells
its history, and indicates the quarter from which
it has been derived. In how many English words
a letter silent to the ear, is yet most eloquent to
the eye&mdash;the <i>g</i> for instance in ‘deign’, ‘feign’,
‘reign’, ‘impugn’, telling as it does of ‘dignor’,
‘fingo’, ‘regno’, ‘impugno’; even as the <i>b</i> in
‘debt’, ‘doubt’, is not idle, but tells of ‘debitum’
and ‘dubium’<a name="FNanchor_233_233" id="FNanchor_233_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Pronunciation Alters</i></div>

<p>At present it is the written word which is in all
languages their conservative element. In it is the
abiding witness against the mutilations or other
capricious changes in their shape which affectation,
folly, ignorance, and half-knowledge would introduce.
It is not indeed always able to hinder the
final adoption of these corrupter forms, but does
not fail to oppose to them a constant, and very
often a successful, resistance. With the adoption
of phonetic spelling, this witness would exist no
longer; whatever was spoken would have also to
be written, let it be never so barbarous, never so
great a departure from the true form of the word.
Nor is it merely probable that such a barbarizing
process, such an adopting and sanctioning of a
vulgarism, might take place, but among phonographers
it already has taken place. We all probably
are aware that there is a vulgar pronunciation of
the word ‘Eu<i>rope</i>’, as though it were ‘Eu<i>rup</i>’.
Now it is quite possible that numerically more
persons in England may pronounce the word
in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
this manner than in the right; and therefore the
phonographers are only true to their principles
when they spell it in the fashion which they do,
‘Eurup’, or indeed omitting the E at the beginning,
‘Urup’<a name="FNanchor_234_234" id="FNanchor_234_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a>
with thus the life of the first syllable
assailed no less than that of the second. What
are the consequences? First its relations with
the old mythology are at once and entirely broken
off; secondly, its most probable etymology from
two Greek words, signifying ‘broad’ and ‘face’,
Europe being so called from the <i>Broad</i> line or <i>face</i>
of coast which our continent presented to the
Asiatic Greek, is totally obscured. But so far from
the spelling servilely following the pronunciation, I
should be bold to affirm that if ninety-nine out of
every hundred persons in England chose to call
Europe ‘Urup’, this would be a vulgarism still,
against which the written word ought to maintain
its protest, not sinking down to their level, but
rather seeking to elevate them to its own<a name="FNanchor_235_235" id="FNanchor_235_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_235_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a>.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Changes of Pronunciation</i></div>

<p>And if there is much in orthography which is
unsettled now, how much more would be unsettled
then. Inasmuch as the pronunciation of words is
continually altering, their spelling would of course
have continually to alter too. For the fact that
pronunciation is undergoing constant changes,
although changes for the most part unmarked, or
marked only by a few, would be abundantly easy
to prove. Take a Pronouncing Dictionary of fifty
or a hundred years ago; turn to almost any page,
and you will observe schemes of pronunciation
there recommended, which are now merely vulgarisms,
or which have been dropped altogether.
We gather from a discussion in Boswell’s <i>Life of
Johnson</i><a name="FNanchor_236_236" id="FNanchor_236_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a>,
that in his time ‘great’ was by some
of the best speakers of the language pronounced
‘gr<i>ee</i>t’, not ‘gr<i>a</i>te’: Pope usually rhymes it with
‘cheat’, ‘complete’, and the like; thus in the
<i>Dunciad</i>:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Here swells the shelf with Ogilby the <i>great</i>,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There, stamped with arms, Newcastle shines com<i>plete</i>”.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Spenser’s constant use of the word a century and
a half earlier, leaves no doubt that such was the
invariable pronunciation of his
time<a name="FNanchor_237_237" id="FNanchor_237_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_237_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a>. Again,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
Pope rhymes ‘obliged’ with ‘beseiged’; and it
has only ceased to be ‘obl<i>ee</i>ged’ almost in our own
time. Who now drinks a cup of ‘tay’? yet there
is abundant evidence that this was the fashionable
pronunciation in the first half of the last century;
the word, that is, was still regarded as French:
Locke writes it ‘thé’; and in Pope’s time, though
no longer written, it was still pronounced so.
Take this couplet of his in proof:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Here thou, great Anna, whom three realms <i>obey</i>,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dost sometimes counsel take, and sometimes <i>tea</i>”.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>So too a pronunciation which still survives,
though scarcely among well-educated persons,
I mean ‘Room’ for ‘Rome’, must have been in
Shakespeare’s time the predominant one, else
there would have been no point in that play on
words where in <i>Julius Cæsar</i> Cassius, complaining
that in all <i>Rome</i> there was not <i>room</i> for a single
man, exclaims,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Now is it <i>Rome</i> indeed, and <i>room</i> enough”.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Samuel Rogers too assures us that in his youth
“everybody said ‘Lonnon’<a name="FNanchor_238_238" id="FNanchor_238_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_238_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a> not ‘London’; that
Fox said ‘Lonnon’ to the last”.</p>

<p>The following quotation from Swift will prove
to you that I have been only employing here an
argument, which he employed long ago against
the phonographers of his time. He exposes thus
the futility of their scheme<a name="FNanchor_239_239" id="FNanchor_239_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_239_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a>: “Another cause
which has contributed not a little to the maiming
of our language, is a foolish opinion advanced of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
late years that we ought to spell exactly as we
speak: which, besides the obvious inconvenience
of utterly destroying our etymology, would be a
thing we should never see an end of. Not only
the several towns and counties of England have
a different way of pronouncing, but even here in
London they clip their words after one manner
about the court, another in the city, and a third
in the suburbs; and in a few years, it is probable,
will all differ from themselves, as fancy or fashion
shall direct; all which, reduced to writing, would
entirely confound orthography”.</p>

<p>This much I have thought good to say in respect
of that entire revolution in English orthography,
which some rash innovators have proposed.
Let me, dismissing them and their innovations,
call your attention now to those changes in spelling
which are constantly going forward, at some
periods more rapidly than at others, but which
never wholly cease out of a language; while at
the same time I endeavour to trace, where this is
possible, the motives and inducements which bring
them about. It is a subject which none can
neglect, who desire to obtain even a tolerably accurate
acquaintance with their native tongue.
Some principles have been laid down in the course
of what has been said already, that may help us
to judge whether the changes which have found
place in our own have been for better or for worse.
We shall find, if I am not mistaken, of both kinds.</p>

<div class="sidenote">‘<i>Grogram</i>’</div>

<p>There are alterations in spelling which are for
the worse. Thus an altered spelling will sometimes
obscure the origin of a word, concealing it
from those who, but for this, would at once have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
known whence and what it was, and would have
found both pleasure and profit in this knowledge.
I need not say that in all those cases where the
earlier spelling revealed the secret of the word,
told its history, which the latter defaces or conceals,
the change has been injurious, and is to be
regretted; while, at the same time, where it has
thoroughly established itself, there is nothing to
do but to acquiesce in it: the attempt to undo
it would be absurd. Thus, when ‘gro<i>c</i>er’ was
spelt ‘gro<i>ss</i>er’, it was comparatively easy to see
that he first had his name, because he sold his
wares not by retail, but in the <i>gross</i>. ‘Co<i>x</i>comb’
tells us nothing now; but it did when spelt, as
it used to be, ‘co<i>cks</i>comb’, the <i>comb</i> of a <i>cock</i>
being then an ensign or token which the fool was
accustomed to wear. In ‘grogra<i>m</i>’ we are
<ins class="correction" title="so in original">entirely</ins>
to seek for the derivation; but in ‘grogra<i>n</i>’
or ‘grogra<i>in</i>’, as earlier it was spelt, one could
scarcely miss ‘grosgrain’, the stuff of a <i>coarse
grain</i> or woof. How many now understand ‘woodbin<i>e</i>’?
but who could have helped understanding
‘woodbin<i>d</i>’ (Ben Jonson)? What a mischievous
alteration in spelling is ‘d<i>i</i>vest’ instead
of ‘d<i>e</i>vest’<a name="FNanchor_240_240" id="FNanchor_240_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_240_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a>. This change is so recent that
I am tempted to ask whether it would not here
be possible to return to the only intelligible spelling
of this word.</p>

<div class="sidenote">‘<i>Pigmy</i>’</div>

<p>‘P<i>i</i>gmy’ used formerly to be spelt ‘p<i>y</i>gmy’,
and so long as it was so, no Greek scholar could
see the word, but at once he knew that by it were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
indicated manikins whose measure in height was
no greater than that of a man’s arm from the
elbow to the closed <i>fist</i><a name="FNanchor_241_241" id="FNanchor_241_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_241_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a>. Now he may know
this in other ways; but the word itself, so long
as he assumes it to be rightly spelt, tells him
nothing. Or again, the old spelling, ‘diam<i>ant</i>’,
was preferable to the modern ‘diam<i>ond</i>’. It
was preferable, because it told more of the quarter
whence the word had reached us. ‘Diamant’
and ‘adamant’ are in fact only two different
adoptions on the part of the English tongue, of
one and the same Greek, which afterwards became
a Latin word. The primary meaning of ‘adamant’
is, as you know, the indomitable, and it
was a name given at first to steel as the hardest
of metals; but afterwards transferred<a name="FNanchor_242_242" id="FNanchor_242_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_242_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a> to the most
precious among all the precious stones, as that
which in power of resistance surpassed everything
besides.</p>

<div class="sidenote">‘<i>Cozen</i>’, ‘<i>Bless</i>’</div>

<p>Neither are new spellings to be commended,
which obliterate or obscure the relationship of a
word with others to which it is really allied; separating
from one another, for those not thoroughly
acquainted with the subject, words of the same
family. Thus when ‘<i>j</i>aw’ was spelt ‘<i>ch</i>aw’, no<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
ne could miss its connexions with the verb ‘to
chew’<a name="FNanchor_243_243" id="FNanchor_243_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_243_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a>. Now probably ninety-nine out of a
hundred who use both words, are entirely unaware
of any relationship between them. It is the same
with ‘cousin’ (consanguineus), and ‘to cozen’ or
to deceive. I do not propose to determine which
of these words should conform itself to the spelling
of the other. There was great irregularity in
the spelling of both from the first; yet for all this,
it was then better than now, when a permanent
distinction has established itself between them,
keeping out of sight that ‘to cozen’ is in all likelihood
to deceive under show of kindred and affinity;
which if it be so, Shakespeare’s words,</p>

The real relation between ‘bliss’ and
‘to bless’ is in like manner at present
obscured<a name="FNanchor_246_246" id="FNanchor_246_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_246_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a>.</p>

<p>The omission of a letter, or the addition of a
letter, may each effectually do its work in keeping
out of sight the true character and origin of
a word. Thus the omission of a letter. When
the first syllable of ‘bran-new’ was spelt ‘bran<i>d</i>’
with a final ‘d’, ‘bran<i>d</i>-new’, how vigorous an
image did the word contain. The ‘brand’ is the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
fire, and ‘brand-new’ equivalent to ‘fire-new’
(Shakespeare), is that which is fresh and bright,
as being newly come from the forge and fire. As
now spelt, ‘bran-new’ conveys to us no image at all.
Again, you have the word ‘scrip’&mdash;as a ‘scrip’
of paper, government ‘scrip’. Is this the same
word with the Saxon ‘scrip’, a wallet, having in
some strange manner obtained these meanings so
different and so remote? Have we here only two
different applications of one and the same word,
or two homonyms, wholly different words, though
spelt alike? We have only to note the way in
which the first of these ‘scrips’ used to be written,
namely with a final ‘t’, not ‘scrip’ but ‘scrip<i>t</i>’,
and we are at once able to answer the question.
This ‘script’ is a Latin, as the other is an Anglo-Saxon,
word, and meant at first simply a <i>written</i>
(scripta) piece of paper&mdash;a circumstance which
since the omission of the final ‘t’ may easily escape
our knowledge. ‘Afraid’ was spelt much better
in old times with the double ‘ff’, than with the
single ‘f’ as now. It was then clear that it was
not another form of ‘afeared’, but wholly separate
from it, the participle of the verb ‘to affray’,
‘affrayer’, or, as it is now written, ‘effrayer’<a name="FNanchor_247_247" id="FNanchor_247_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_247_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">‘<i>Whole</i>’, ‘<i>Hale</i>’, ‘<i>Heal</i>’</div>

<p>In the cases hitherto adduced, it has been the
omission of a letter which has clouded and concealed
the etymology. The intrusion of a letter
sometimes does the same. Thus in the early editions
of <i>Paradise Lost</i>, and in all writers of that
time, you will find ‘scent’, an odour, spelt ‘sent’.
It was better so; there is no other noun sub<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>stantive
‘sent’, with which it is in danger of
being confounded; while its relation with ‘sentio’,
with ‘re<i>sent</i>’<a name="FNanchor_248_248" id="FNanchor_248_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_248_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a>,
‘dis<i>sent</i>’, and the like, is put out
of sight by its novel spelling; the intrusive ‘<i>c</i>’,
serves only to mislead. The same thing was
attempted with ‘site’, ‘situate’, ‘situation’,
spelt for a time by many, ‘s<i>c</i>ite’, ‘s<i>c</i>ituate’,
‘s<i>c</i>ituation’; but it did not continue with these.
Again, ‘whole’, in Wiclif’s Bible, and indeed much
later, occasionally as far down as Spenser, is spelt
‘hole’, without the ‘w’ at the beginning. The
present orthography may have the advantage of at
once distinguishing the word to the eye from any
other; but at the same time the initial ‘w’, now
prefixed, hides its relation to the verb ‘to heal’,
with which it is closely allied. The ‘whole’ man
is he whose hurt is ‘healed’ or
covered<a name="FNanchor_249_249" id="FNanchor_249_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_249_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a> (we say
of the convalescent that he
‘recovers’)<a name="FNanchor_250_250" id="FNanchor_250_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_250_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a>; ‘whole’
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>being closely allied to ‘hale’ (integer), from which
also by its modern spelling it is divided. ‘Wholesome’
has naturally followed the fortunes of
‘whole’; it was spelt ‘holsome’ once.</p>

<p>Of ‘island’ too our present spelling is inferior to
the old, inasmuch as it suggests a hybrid formation,
as though the word were made up of the
Latin ‘insula’, and the Saxon ‘land’. It is quite
true that ‘isle’ <i>is</i> in relation with, and descent
from, ‘insula’, ‘isola’, ‘île’; and hence probably
the misspelling of ‘island’. This last however has
nothing to do with ‘insula’, being identical with
the German ‘eiland’, the Anglo-Saxon ‘ealand’<a name="FNanchor_251_251" id="FNanchor_251_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_251_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a>
and signifying the sea-land, or land girt, round
with the sea. And it is worthy of note that this
‘s’ in the first syllable of ‘island’ is quite of
modern introduction. In all the earlier versions
of the Scriptures, and in the Authorized Version
as at first set forth, it is ‘iland’; while in proof
that this is not accidental, it may be observed
that, while ‘iland’ has not the ‘s’, ‘isle’ has it
(see Rev. i. 9). ‘Iland’ indeed is the spelling
which we meet with far down into the seventeenth
century.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Folk-etymologies</i></div>

<p>What has just been said of ‘island’ leads me as
by a natural transition to observe that one of the
most frequent causes of alteration in the spelling
of a word is a wrongly assumed derivation. It is
then sought to bring the word into harmony with,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
and to make it by its spelling suggest, this derivation,
which has been erroneously thrust upon it.
Here is a subject which, followed out as it deserves,
would form an interesting and instructive chapter
in the history of language<a name="FNanchor_252_252" id="FNanchor_252_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_252_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a>.
Let me offer one or
two small contributions to it; noting first by the
way how remarkable an evidence we have in this
fact, of the manner in which not the learned only,
but all persons learned and unlearned alike, crave
to have these words not body only, but
body and soul. What an attestation, I say, of
this lies in the fact that where a word in its proper
derivation is unintelligible to them, they will shape
and mould it into some other form, not enduring
that it should be a mere inert sound without sense
in their ears; and if they do not know its right
origin, will rather put into it a wrong one, than
that it should have for them no meaning, and
suggest no derivation at all<a name="FNanchor_253_253" id="FNanchor_253_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_253_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a>.</p>

<p>There is probably no language in which such a
process has not been going forward; in which it is
not the explanation, in a vast number of instances,
of changes in spelling and even in form, which
words have undergone. I will offer a few examples
of it from foreign tongues, before adducing
any from our own. ‘Pyramid’ is a word, the
spelling of which was affected in the Greek by an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
erroneous assumption of its derivation; the
consequences of this error surviving in our own
word to the present day. It is spelt by us with
a ‘y’ in the first syllable, as it was spelt with the
<ins class="correction" title="Greek: y;
original reads ‘v’">υ</ins> corresponding in the Greek. But why was this?
It was because the Greeks assumed that the pyramids
were so named from their having the appearance
of <i>flame</i> going up into a
point<a name="FNanchor_254_254" id="FNanchor_254_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_254_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a>, and so they
spelt ‘pyramid’, that they might find <span title="Greek: pyr">πῦρ</span> or
‘pyre’ in it; while in fact ‘pyramid’ has nothing
to do with flame or fire at all; being, as those best
qualified to speak on the matter declare to us, an
Egyptian word of quite a different
signification<a name="FNanchor_255_255" id="FNanchor_255_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_255_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a>,
and the Coptic letters being much better represented
by the diphthong ‘ei’ than by the letter ‘y’,
as no doubt, but for this mistaken notion of what
the word was intended to mean, they would have
been.</p>

<p>Once more&mdash;the form ‘Hierosolyma’, wherein
the Greeks reproduced the Hebrew ‘Jerusalem’,
was intended in all probability to express that the
city so called was the <i>sacred</i> city of the
<i>Solymi</i><a name="FNanchor_256_256" id="FNanchor_256_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_256_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a>.
At all events the intention not merely of reproducing
the Hebrew word, but also of making it
significant in Greek, of finding <span title="Greek: hieron">ἱερόν</span> in it, is
plainly discernible. For indeed the Greeks were
exceedingly intolerant of foreign words, till
they had laid aside their foreign appearance<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>&mdash;of
all words which they could not thus quicken
with a Greek soul; and, with a very characteristic
vanity, an ignoring of all other tongues but their
own, assumed with no apparent misgivings that
all words, from whatever quarter derived, were
to be explained by Greek
etymologies<a name="FNanchor_257_257" id="FNanchor_257_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_257_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a>.</p>

<p>‘Tartar’ is another word, of which it is at least
possible that a wrongly assumed derivation has<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
modified the spelling, and indeed not the spelling
only, but the very shape in which we now possess
it. To many among us it may be known that the
people designated by this appellation are not properly
‘Tartars’, but ‘Tatars’; and you sometimes
perhaps have noted the omission of the ‘r’ on the
part of those who are curious in their spelling.
How, then, it may be asked, did the form ‘Tartar’
arise? When the terrible hordes of middle Asia
burst in upon civilized Europe in the thirteenth
century, many beheld in the ravages of their innumerable
cavalry a fulfilment of that prophetic word
in the Revelation (chap. ix.) concerning the opening
of the bottomless pit; and from this belief
ensued the change of their name from ‘Tatars’ to
‘Tartars’, which was thus put into closer relation
with ‘Tartarus’ or hell, out of which their multitudes
were supposed to have proceeded<a name="FNanchor_258_258" id="FNanchor_258_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_258_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a>.</p>

<p>Another good example in the same kind is the
German word ‘sündflut’, the Deluge, which is
now so spelt as to signify a ‘sinflood’, the plague
or <i>flood</i> of waters brought on the world by the
<i>sins</i> of mankind; and probably some of us have
before this admired the pregnant significance of
the word. Yet the old High German word had
originally no such intention; it was spelt ‘sinfluot’,
that is, the great flood; and as late as Luther,
indeed in Luther’s own translation of the Bible,
is so spelt as to make plain that the notion of a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
‘<i>sin</i>-flood’ had not yet found its way into, even
as it had not affected the spelling of, the
word<a name="FNanchor_259_259" id="FNanchor_259_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_259_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">‘<i>Currants</i>’</div>

<p>But to look now nearer home for our examples.
The little raisins brought from Greece, which play
so important a part in one of the national dishes
of England, the Christmas plum-pudding, used to
be called ‘corinths’; and so you would find them
in mercantile lists of a hundred years ago: either
that for the most part they were shipped from
Corinth, the principal commercial city in Greece,
or because they grew in large abundance in the
immediate district round about it. Their likeness
in shape and size and general appearance to our
own currants, working together with the ignorance
of the great majority of English people about any
such place as Corinth, soon brought the name
‘corinths’ into ‘currants’, which now with a
certain unfitness they bear; being not currants at
all, but dried grapes, though grapes of diminutive
size<a name="FNanchor_260_260" id="FNanchor_260_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_260_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">‘<i>Court-cards</i>’</div>

<p>‘<i>Court</i>-cards’, that is, the king, queen, and
knave in each suit, were once
‘coat-cards’<a name="FNanchor_261_261" id="FNanchor_261_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_261_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a>;
having their name from the long splendid ‘coat’
(vestis talaris) with which they were arrayed.
Probably ‘coat’ after a while did not perfectly
convey its original meaning and intention; being
no more in common use for the long garment
reach<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>ing
down to the heels; and then ‘coat’ was easily
exchanged for ‘court’, as the word is now both
spelt and pronounced, seeing that nowhere so
fitly as in a Court should such splendidly arrayed
personages be found. A public house in the
neighbourhood of London having a few years
since for its sign “The George <i>Canning</i>” is already
“The George and <i>Cannon</i>”,&mdash;so rapidly do these
transformations proceed, so soon is that forgotten
which we suppose would never be forgotten.
“Welsh <i>rarebit</i>” becomes
“Welsh <i>rabbit</i>”<a name="FNanchor_262_262" id="FNanchor_262_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_262_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a>;
and ‘<i>farced</i>’ or stuffed ‘meat’ becomes “forced
meat”. Even the mere determination to make a
word <i>look</i> English, to put it into an English shape,
without thereby so much as seeming to attain
any result in the way of etymology, this is very
often sufficient to bring about a change in its
spelling, and even in its
form<a name="FNanchor_263_263" id="FNanchor_263_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_263_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a>. It is thus that
‘sipahi’ has become ‘sepoy’; and only so could
‘weissager’ have taken its present form of
‘wiseacre’<a name="FNanchor_264_264" id="FNanchor_264_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_264_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a>.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Transformation of Words</i></div>

<p>It is not very uncommon for a word, while it is
derived from one word, to receive a certain impulse
and modification from another. This extends
sometimes beyond the spelling, and in cases where
it does so, would hardly belong to our present
theme. Still I may notice an instance or two.
Thus our ‘obsequies’ is the Latin ‘exequiæ’,
but formed under a certain impulse of ‘obsequium’,
and seeking to express and include the observant
honour of that word. ‘To refuse’ is ‘recusare’,
while yet it has derived the ‘f’ of its second
syllable from ‘refutare’; it is a medley of the
two<a name="FNanchor_265_265" id="FNanchor_265_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_265_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a>. The French ‘rame’, an oar, is ‘remus’,
but that modified by an unconscious recollection
of ‘ramus’. ‘Orange’ is no doubt a Persian
word, which has reached us through the Arabic,
and which the Spanish ‘naranja’ more nearly
represents than any form of it existing in the
other languages of Europe. But what so natural
as to think of the orange as the <i>golden</i> fruit,
especially when the “<i>aurea</i> mala” of the Hesperides
were familiar to all antiquity? There
cannot be a doubt that ‘aurum’, ‘oro’, ‘or’,
made themselves felt in the shapes which the
word assumed in the languages of the West, and
that here we have the explanation of the change
in the first syllable, as in the low Latin ‘aurantium’,
‘orangia’, and in the French ‘orange’,
which has given us our own.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span></p>

<p>It is foreign words, or words adopted from
foreign languages, as might beforehand be expected,
which are especially subjected to such
transformations as these. The soul which the
word once had in its own language, having, for as
many as do not know that language, departed
from it, or at least not being now any more to be
recognized by such as employ the word, these are
not satisfied till they have put another soul into it,
and it has thus become alive to them again. Thus&mdash;to
take first one or two very familiar instances,
but which serve as well as any other to illustrate
my position&mdash;the Bellerophon becomes for our
sailors the ‘Billy Ruffian’, for what can they know
of the Greek mythology, or of the slayer of Chimæra?
an iron steamer, the Hirondelle, now or
lately plying on the Tyne, is the ‘Iron Devil’.
‘<i>Contre</i> danse’, or dance in which the parties
stand <i>face to face</i> with one another, and which
ought to have appeared in English as ‘<i>counter</i>
dance’, does become
‘<i>country</i> dance’<a name="FNanchor_266_266" id="FNanchor_266_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_266_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a>, as though
it were the dance of the country folk and rural<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
districts, as distinguished from the quadrille
and waltz and more artificial dances of the
town<a name="FNanchor_267_267" id="FNanchor_267_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_267_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a>.
A well known rose, the “rose <i>des quatre saisons</i>”,
or of the four seasons, becomes on the lips of
some of our gardeners, the “rose of the <i>quarter
sessions</i>”, though here it is probable that the eye
has misled, rather than the ear. ‘Dent de lion’,
(it is spelt ‘dentdelyon’ in our early writers)
becomes ‘dandylion’, “<i>chaude</i> melée”, or an
affray in <i>hot</i> blood,
“<i>chance</i>-medley”<a name="FNanchor_268_268" id="FNanchor_268_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_268_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a>, ‘causey’
(chaussée) becomes
‘causeway’<a name="FNanchor_269_269" id="FNanchor_269_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_269_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a>, ‘rachitis’
‘rickets’<a name="FNanchor_270_270" id="FNanchor_270_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_270_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a>,
and in French ‘mandragora’ ‘main
de gloire’<a name="FNanchor_271_271" id="FNanchor_271_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_271_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">‘<i>Necromancy</i>’</div>

<p>‘Necromancy’ is another word which, if not
now, yet for a long period was erroneously spelt,
and indeed assumed a different shape, under the
influence of an erroneous derivation; which,
curiously enough, even now that it has been dismissed,
has left behind it the marks of its presence,
in our common phrase, “the <i>Black</i> Art”.
I need hardly remind you that ‘necromancy’ is a
Greek word, which signifies, according to its
proper meaning, a prophesying by aid of the dead,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
or that it rests on the presumed power of raising
up by potent spells the dead, and compelling
them to give answers about things to come. We
all know that it was supposed possible to exercise
such power; we have a very awful example of it
in the story of the witch of Endor, and a very
<ins class="correction" title="original reads ‘horried’">horrid</ins>
one in Lucan<a name="FNanchor_272_272" id="FNanchor_272_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_272_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a>.
But the Latin medieval
writers, whose Greek was either little or none,
spelt the word, ‘nigromantia’, as if its first syllables
had been Latin: at the same time, not wholly
forgetting the original meaning, but in fact getting
round to it though by a wrong process, they
understood the dead by these ‘nigri’, or blacks,
whom they had brought into the word<a name="FNanchor_273_273" id="FNanchor_273_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_273_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a>. Down
to a rather late period we find the forms, ‘<i>negro</i>mancer’
and ‘<i>negro</i>mancy’ frequent in English.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Words Misspelt</i></div>

<p>‘Pleurisy’ used often to be spelt, (I do not
think it is so now,) without an ‘e’ in the first
syllable, evidently on the tacit assumption that
it was from <i>plus pluris</i><a name="FNanchor_274_274" id="FNanchor_274_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_274_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a>. When Shakespeare
falls into an error, he “makes the offence gracious”;
yet, I think, he would scarcely have written,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“For goodness growing to a <i>plurisy</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dies of his own <i>too much</i>”,<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>but that <i>he</i> too derived ‘plurisy’ from <i>pluris</i>.
This, even with the “small Latin and less Greek”,
which Ben Jonson allows him, he scarcely would
have done, had the word presented itself in that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
form, which by right of its descent from <span title="Greek: pleura">πλευρά</span>
(being a pain, stitch, or sickness <i>in the side</i>) it
ought to have possessed. Those who for ‘crucible’
wrote ‘chrysoble’ (Jeremy Taylor does so)
must evidently have done this under the assumption
that the Greek for <i>gold</i>, and not the Latin
for <i>cross</i>, lay at the foundation of this word.
‘Anthymn’ instead of ‘anthem’ (Barrow so spells
the word), rests plainly on a wrong etymology,
even as this spelling clearly betrays what that
wrong etymology is. ‘Rhyme’ with a ‘y’ is a
modern misspelling; and would never have been
but for the undue influence which the Greek
‘rhythm’ has exercised upon it. Spenser and his
cotemporaries spell it ‘rime’. ‘Abominable’ was
by some etymologists of the seventeenth century
spelt ‘abhominable’, as though it were that which
departed from the human (ab homine) into the
bestial or devilish.</p>

<p>In all these words which I have adduced last,
the correct spelling has in the end resumed its
sway. It is not so with ‘frontisp<i>ie</i>ce’, which
ought to be spelt ‘frontisp<i>i</i>ce’ (it was so by
Milton and others), being the low Latin ‘frontispicium’,
from ‘frons’ and ‘aspicio’, the forefront
of the building, that part which presents
itself to the view. It was only the entirely
ungrounded notion that the word ‘piece’ constitutes
the last syllable, which has given rise to
our present orthography<a name="FNanchor_275_275" id="FNanchor_275_275"></a><a href="#Footnote_275_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a>.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Wrong Spelling</div>

<p>You may, perhaps, wonder that I have dwelt
so long on these details of spelling; that I have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
bestowed on them so much of my own attention,
that I have claimed for them so much of yours;
yet in truth I cannot regard them as unworthy
of our very closest heed. For indeed of how
much beyond itself is accurate or inaccurate
spelling the certain indication. Thus when we
meet ‘s<i>y</i>ren’, for ‘s<i>i</i>ren’, as so strangely often
we do, almost always in newspapers, and often
where we should hardly have expected (I met
it lately in the <i>Quarterly Review</i>, and again in
Gifford’s <i>Massinger</i>), how difficult it is not to be
“judges of evil thoughts”, and to take this
slovenly misspelling as the specimen and evidence
of an inaccuracy and ignorance which reaches
very far wider than the single word which is
before us. But why is it that so much significance
is ascribed to a wrong spelling? Because ignorance
of a word’s spelling at once argues ignorance
of its origin and derivation. I do not mean
that one who spells rightly may not be ignorant
of it too, but he who spells wrongly is certainly
so. Thus, to recur to the example I have just
adduced, he who for ‘s<i>i</i>ren’ writes ‘s<i>y</i>ren’,
certainly knows nothing of the magic <i>cords</i>
(<span title="Greek: seirai">σειραί</span>) of song,
by which those fair enchantresses
were supposed to draw those that heard them
to their ruin<a name="FNanchor_276_276" id="FNanchor_276_276"></a><a href="#Footnote_276_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a>.</p>

<p>Correct or incorrect orthography being, then,
this note of accurate or inaccurate knowledge,
we may confidently conclude where two spellings<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
of a word exist, and are both employed by persons
who generally write with precision and scholarship,
that there must be something to account for this.
It will generally be worth your while to inquire
into the causes which enable both spellings to
hold their ground and to find their supporters,
not ascribing either one or the other to mere
carelessness or error. It will in these cases often
be found that two spellings exist, because two
views of the word’s origin exist, and each of those
spellings is the correct expression of one of these.
The question therefore which way of spelling
should continue, and wholly supersede the other,
and which, while the alternative remains, we
should ourselves employ, can only be settled by
settling which of these etymologies deserves the
preference. So is it, for example, with ‘ch<i>y</i>mist’
and ‘ch<i>e</i>mist’, neither of which has obtained in
our common use the complete mastery over the
other<a name="FNanchor_277_277" id="FNanchor_277_277"></a><a href="#Footnote_277_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a>. It is not here, as in some other cases,
that one is certainly right, the other as certainly
wrong: but they severally represent two different
etymologies of the word, and each is correct
according to its own. If we are to spell ‘ch<i>y</i>mist’
and ‘ch<i>y</i>mistry’, it is because these words are
considered to be derived from the Greek word,
<ins class="correction" title="Greek: chymos;
original reads ‘χ υμο’">χυμός</ins>,
sap; and the chymic art will then have
occupied itself first with distilling the juice and
sap of plants, and will from this have derived its
name. I have little doubt, however, that the
other spelling, ‘ch<i>e</i>mist’, not ‘ch<i>y</i>mist’, is the
correct one. It was not with the distillation of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
herbs, but with the amalgamation of metals,
that chemistry occupied itself at its rise, and
the word embodies a reference to Egypt, the land
of Ham or ‘Cham’<a name="FNanchor_278_278" id="FNanchor_278_278"></a><a href="#Footnote_278_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a>, in which this art was first
practised with success.</p>

<div class="sidenote">‘<i>Satyr</i>’, ‘<i>Satire</i>’</div>

<p>Of how much confusion the spelling which used
to be so common, ‘satyr’ for ‘satire’, is at once
the consequence, the expression, and again the
cause; not indeed that this confusion first began
with us<a name="FNanchor_279_279" id="FNanchor_279_279"></a><a href="#Footnote_279_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a>; for the same already found place in
the Latin, where ‘satyricus’ was continually
written for ‘satiricus’ out of a false assumption
of the identity between the Roman <i>satire</i> and
the Greek <i>satyric</i> drama. The Roman ‘satira’,&mdash;I
speak of things familiar to many of my hearers,&mdash;is
properly a <i>full</i> dish (lanx being understood)&mdash;a
dish heaped up with various ingredients, a ‘farce’
(according to the original signification of that
word), or hodge-podge; and the word was
transferred from this to a form of poetry which
at first admitted the utmost variety in the mate<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>rials
of which it was composed, and the shapes
into which these materials were wrought up;
being the only form of poetry which the Romans
did <i>not</i> borrow from the Greeks. Wholly different
from this, having no one point of contact with
it in its form, its history, or its intention, is the
‘satyric’ drama of Greece, so called because
Silenus and the ‘Satyrs’ supplied the chorus;
and in their naïve selfishness, and mere animal
instincts, held up before men a mirror of what
they would be, if only the divine, which is also
the truly human, element of humanity, were withdrawn;
what man, all that properly made him
man being withdrawn, would prove.</p>

<div class="sidenote">‘<i>Mid-wife</i>’, ‘<i>Nostril</i>’</div>

<p>And then what light, as we have already seen,
does the older spelling of a word often cast upon
its etymology; how often does it clear up the
mystery, which would otherwise have hung about
it, or which <i>had</i> hung about it till some one had
noticed and turned to profit this its earlier spelling.
Thus ‘dirge’ is always spelt ‘dirige’ in early
English. This ‘dirige’ may be the first word in
a Latin psalm or prayer once used at funerals;
there is a reasonable probability that the explanation
of the word is here; at any rate, if it is not
here, it is nowhere<a name="FNanchor_280_280" id="FNanchor_280_280"></a><a href="#Footnote_280_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a>.
The derivation of ‘mid-wife’
is uncertain, and has been the subject of
discussion; but when we find it spelt ‘medewife’
and ‘meadwife’, in Wiclif’s Bible, this leaves
hardly a doubt that it is the <i>wife</i> or woman who<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
acts for a <i>mead</i> or
reward<a name="FNanchor_281_281" id="FNanchor_281_281"></a><a href="#Footnote_281_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a>.
In cases too where
there was no mystery hanging about a word,
how often does the early spelling make clear
to all that which was before only known to those
who had made the language their study. For
example, if an early edition of Spenser should
come into your hands, or a modern one in which
the early spelling is retained, what continual
lessons in English might you derive from it. Thus
‘nostril’ is always spelt by him and his cotemporaries
‘nosethrill’; a little earlier it was
‘nosethirle’. Now ‘to thrill’ is the same as
to drill or pierce; it is plain then here at once
that the word signifies the orifice or opening
with which the <i>nose</i> is <i>thrilled</i>, drilled, or pierced.
We might have read the word for ever in our
modern spelling without being taught this.
‘Ell’ tells us nothing about itself; but in ‘eln’
used in Holland’s translation of Camden, we
recognize ‘ulna’ at once.</p>

<p>Again, the ‘morris’ or ‘morrice-dance’, which
is alluded to so often by our early poets, as it is
now spelt informs us nothing about itself; but
read ‘<i>moriske</i> dance’, as it is generally spelt by
Holland and his cotemporaries, and you will
scarcely fail to perceive that of which indeed
there is no manner of doubt; namely, that it
was so called either because it was really, or was
supposed to be, a dance in use among the <i>moriscoes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span></i>
of Spain, and from thence introduced into
England<a name="FNanchor_282_282" id="FNanchor_282_282"></a><a href="#Footnote_282_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a>.</p>

<p>Again, philologers tell us, and no doubt rightly,
that our ‘cray-fish’, or ‘craw-fish’, is the
French ‘écrevisse’. This is true, but certainly
it is not self-evident. Trace however the word
through these successive spellings, ‘krevys’ (Lydgate),
‘crevish’ (Gascoigne), ‘craifish’ (Holland),
and the chasm between ‘cray-fish’ or ‘craw-fish’
and ‘écrevisse’ is by aid of these three intermediate
spellings bridged over at once; and in
the fact of our Gothic ‘fish’ finding its way into
this French word we see only another example
of a law, which has been already abundantly
illustrated in this lecture<a name="FNanchor_283_283" id="FNanchor_283_283"></a><a href="#Footnote_283_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a>.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">‘<i>Emmet</i>’, ‘<i>Ant</i>’</div>

<p>In other ways also an accurate taking note of
the spelling of words, and of the successive changes
which it has undergone, will often throw light
upon them. Thus we may know, others having
assured us of the fact, that ‘ant’ and ‘emmet’
were originally only two different spellings of one
and the same word; but we may be perplexed
to understand how two forms of a word, now so
different, could ever have diverged from a single
root. When however we find the different spellings,
‘emmet’, ‘emet’, ‘amet’, ‘amt’, ‘ant’,
the gulf which appeared to separate ‘emmet’
from ‘ant’ is bridged over at once, and we do
not merely know on the assurance of others
that these two are in fact identical, their differences
being only superficial, but we perceive
clearly in what manner they are so<a name="FNanchor_284_284" id="FNanchor_284_284"></a><a href="#Footnote_284_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a>.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span></p>

<p>Even before any close examination of the
matter, it is hard not to suspect that ‘runagate’
is in fact another form of ‘renegade’, slightly
transformed, as so many words, to put an English
signification into its first syllable; and then the
meaning gradually modified in obedience to the
new derivation which was assumed to be its
original and true one. Our suspicion of this is
very greatly strengthened (for we see how very
closely the words approach one another), by the
fact that ‘renega<i>d</i>e’ is constantly spelt ‘renega<i>t</i>e’
in our old authors, while at the same time the
denial of <i>faith</i>, which is now a necessary element
in ‘renegade’, and one differencing it inwardly
from ‘runagate’, is altogether wanting in early
use&mdash;the denial of <i>country</i> and of the duties thereto
owing being all that is implied in it. Thus it is
constantly employed in Holland’s <i>Livy</i> as a
rendering of ‘perfuga’<a name="FNanchor_285_285" id="FNanchor_285_285"></a><a href="#Footnote_285_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a>;
while in the one passage
where ‘runagate’ occurs in the Prayer Book
Version of the Psalms (Ps. lxviii. 6), a reference
to the original will show that the translators
could only have employed it there on the ground
that it also expressed rebel, revolter, and not
runaway merely<a name="FNanchor_286_286" id="FNanchor_286_286"></a><a href="#Footnote_286_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Assimilating Power of English</i></div>

<p>I might easily occupy your attention much
longer, so little barren or unfruitful does this
subject of spelling appear likely to prove; but
all things must have an end; and as I concluded
my first lecture with a remarkable testimony<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
borne by an illustrious German scholar to the
merits of our English tongue, I will conclude my
last with the words of another, not indeed a
German, but still of the great Germanic stock;
words resuming in themselves much of which
we have been speaking upon this and upon
former occasions: “As our bodies”, he says,
“have hidden resources and expedients, to remove
the obstacles which the very art of the physician
puts in its way, so language, ruled by an indomitable
inward principle, triumphs in some degree
over the folly of grammarians. Look at the
English, polluted by Danish and Norman conquests,
distorted in its genuine and noble features
by old and recent endeavours to mould it after
the French fashion, invaded by a hostile entrance
of Greek and Latin words, threatening by increasing
hosts to overwhelm the indigenous terms.
In these long contests against the combined power
of so many forcible enemies, the language, it is
true, has lost some of its power of inversion in
the structure of sentences, the means of denoting
the difference of gender, and the nice distinctions
by inflection and termination&mdash;almost every
word is attacked by the spasm of the accent and
the drawing of consonants to wrong positions;
yet the old English principle is not overpowered.
Trampled down by the ignoble feet of strangers,
its springs still retain force enough to restore
itself. It lives and plays through all the veins
of the language; it impregnates the innumerable
strangers entering its dominions with its temper,
and stains them with its colour, not unlike the
Greek which in taking up oriental words, stripped<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
them of their foreign costume, and bid them to
appear as native Greeks”<a name="FNanchor_287_287" id="FNanchor_287_287"></a><a href="#Footnote_287_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a>.</p>

Let me illustrate this by further instances in a note.
Thus <span title="Greek: boutyron">βούτυρον</span>, from which, through the Latin, our
‘butter’ has descended to us, is borrowed (Pliny, <i>H.N.</i>
xxviii. 9) from a Scythian word, now to us unknown:
yet it is sufficiently plain that the Greeks so shaped and
spelt it as to contain apparent allusion to <i>cow</i> and <i>cheese</i>;
there is in <span title="Greek: boutyron">βούτυρον</span> an evident
feeling after <span title="Greek: bous">βοῦς</span> and
<span title="Greek: tyron">τυρόν</span>. Bozra, meaning citadel in Hebrew and Phœnician,
and the name, no doubt, which the citadel of Carthage
bore, becomes <span title="Greek: Byrsa">Βύρσα</span> on Greek lips; and then the well
known legend of the ox-hide was invented upon the
name; not having suggested it, but being itself suggested
by it. Herodian (v. 6) reproduces the name of the
Syrian goddess Astarte in a shape that is significant also
for Greek ears&mdash;<span title="Greek: Astroarchê">Ἀστροάρχη</span>,
The Star-ruler, or Star-queen.
When the apostate and hellenizing Jews assumed
Greek names, ‘Eliakim’ or “Whom God has set”,
became ‘Alcimus’ (<span title="Greek: alkimos">ἄλκιμος</span>) or The Strong (1 Macc.
vii. 5). Latin examples in like kind are ‘com<i>i</i>ssatio’,
spelt continually ‘com<i>e</i>ssatio’, and ‘com<i>e</i>ssation’ by
those who sought to naturalize it in England, as though
it were connected with ‘cŏmedo’, to eat, being indeed
the substantive from the verb ‘cōmissari’
(&mdash;<span title="Greek: kômazein">κωμάζειν</span>),
to revel, as Plutarch, whose Latin is in general not very
accurate, long ago correctly observed; and ‘orichalcum’,
spelt often ‘<i>au</i>richalcum’, as though it were a
composite metal of mingled <i>gold</i> and brass; being indeed
the <i>mountain</i> brass (<span title="Greek: oreichalkos">ὀρείχαλκος</span>). The miracle play,
which is ‘mystère’, in French, whence our English
‘mystery’ was originally written ‘mistère’, being properly
derived from ‘ministère’, and having its name
because the clergy, the <i>ministri</i> Ecclesiæ, conducted it.

Exactly the same happens in other languages; thus
‘armbrust’, a crossbow, <i>looks</i> German enough, and yet
has nothing to do with ‘arm’ or ‘brust’, being a contraction
of ‘arcubalista’, but a contraction under these
influences. As little has ‘abenteuer’ anything to do
with ‘abend’ or ‘theuer’, however it may seem to be
connected with them, being indeed the

It is upon this word that De Quincey (<i>Life and
Manners</i>, p. 70, American Ed.) says excellently well:
“It is in fact by such corruptions, by off-sets upon an
old stock, arising through ignorance or mispronunciation
originally, that every language is frequently enriched;
and new modifications of thought, unfolding themselves
in the progress of society, generate for themselves concurrently
appropriate expressions.... It must not
be allowed to weigh against a word once fairly naturalized
by all, that originally it crept in upon an abuse or a
corruption. Prescription is as strong a ground of legitimation
in a case of this nature, as it is in law. And the
old axiom is applicable&mdash;Fieri non debuit, factum valet.
Were it otherwise, languages would be robbed of much
of their wealth”. [<i>Works</i>, vol. xiv., p. 201.]</p></div>

As ‘orthography’ itself means properly “<i>right</i>
spelling”, it might be a curious question whether it is
permissible to speak of an <i>incorrect</i> <i>ortho</i>graphy, that is
of a <i>wrong</i> <i>right</i>-spelling. The question which would be
thus started is one of not unfrequent recurrence, and it
is very worthy of observation how often, so soon as we
take note of etymologies, this <i>contradictio in adjecto</i> is
found to occur. I will here adduce a few examples from
the Greek, the Latin, the German, and from our own
tongue. Thus the Greeks having no convenient word
to express a rider, apart from a rider <i>on a horse</i>, did not
scruple to speak of the <i>horse</i>man (<span title="Greek: hippeus">ἱππεύς</span>) upon an <i>elephant</i>.
They often allowed themselves in a like inaccuracy, where
certainly there was no necessity; as in using <span title="Greek: andrias">ἀνδριάς</span> of
the statue of a <i>woman</i>; where it would have been quite
as easy to have used <span title="Greek: heikôn">εἱκών</span> or
<span title="Greek: agalma">ἄγαλμα</span>. So too their
‘table’ (<span title="Greek: trapeza">τράπεζα</span> =
<span title="Greek: tetrapeza">τετράπεζα</span>) involved probably the
<i>four</i> feet which commonly support one; yet they did not
shrink from speaking of a <i>three</i>-footed table
(<span title="Greek: tripous trapeza">τρίπους τράπεζα</span>),
in other words, a “<i>three</i>-footed <i>four</i>-footed”; much as
though we should speak of a “<i>three</i>-footed <i>quadru</i>ped”.
Homer writes of a ‘hecatomb’ not of a <i>hundred</i>, but of
twelve, oxen; and elsewhere of Hebe he says, in words
not reproducible in English,
<span title="Greek: nektar eônochoei">νέκταρ ἐωνοχόει</span>. ‘Tetrarchs’
were often rulers of quite other than <i>fourth</i> parts of a
land. <span title="Greek: Akratos">Ἀκρατος</span>
had so come to stand for wine, without
any thought more of its signifying originally the <i>unmingled</i>,
that St. John speaks of
<span title="Greek: akratos kekerasmenos">ἄκρατος κεκερασμένος</span> (Rev.
xiv. 10), or the unmingled mingled. Boxes in which
precious ointments were contained were so commonly of
alabaster, that the name came to be applied to them
whether they were so or not; and Theocritus celebrates
“<i>golden</i> alabasters”. Cicero having to mention a water-clock
is obliged to call it a <i>water</i> <i>sun</i>dial (solarium ex
aquâ). Columella speaks of a “<i>vintage</i> of honey” (vindemia
mellis), and Horace invites his friend to im<i>pede</i>, not
his <i>foot</i>, but his head, with myrtle (<i>caput</i> im<i>ped</i>ire myrto).
Thus too a German writer who desired to tell of the golden
shoes with which the folly of Caligula adorned his horse
could scarcely avoid speaking of <i>golden</i> hoof-<i>irons</i>. The
same inner contradiction is involved in such language as
our own, a “<i>false</i> <i>ver</i>dict”, a “<i>steel</i> <i>cuirass</i>” (‘coriacea’
from corium, leather), “antics new” (Harrington’s
<i>Ariosto</i>), an “<i>erroneous</i> <i>etymo</i>logy”, a “<i>corn</i> <i>chandler</i>”;
that is, a “<i>corn</i> <i>candle</i>-maker”, “<i>rather</i> <i>late</i>”, ‘rather’
being the comparative of ‘rathe’, early, and thus “rather
late” being indeed “more early late”; and in others.</p></div>

We have a notable evidence how deeply rooted this
error was, how long this confusion endured, of the way in
which it was shared by the learned as well as the
unlearned, in Milton’s <i>Apology for Smectymnuus</i>, sect. 7,
which everywhere presumes the identity of the ‘satyr’
and the ‘satirist’. It was Isaac Casaubon who first
effectually dissipated it even for the learned world. The
results of his investigations were made popular for the
unlearned reader by Dryden, in the very instructive
<i>Discourse on Satirical Poetry</i>, prefixed to his translations
of Juvenal; but the confusion still survives, and ‘satyrs’
and ‘satires’, the Greek ‘satyric’ drama, the Latin
‘satirical’ poetry, are still assumed by most to have
something to do with one another.</p></div>

In the reprinting of old books it is often very difficult
to determine how far the old shape in which words present
themselves should be retained, how far they should be
conformed to present usage. It is comparatively easy
to lay down as a rule that in books intended for popular
use, wherever the form of the word is not affected by the
modernizing of the spelling, as where this modernizing
consists merely in the dropping of superfluous letters,
there it shall take place; as who would wish our Bibles
to be now printed letter for letter after the edition of
1611, or Shakespeare with the orthography of the first
folio; but wherever more than the spelling, the actual
shape, outline, and character of the word has been
affected by the changes which it has undergone, that in
all such cases the earlier form shall be held fast. The
rule is a judicious one; but when it is attempted to carry
it out, it is not always easy to draw the line, and to
determine what affects the form and essence of a word,
and what does not. About some words there can be no
doubt; and therefore when a modern editor of Fuller’s
<i>Church History</i> complacently announces that he has
allowed himself in such changes as ‘dirige’ into ‘dirge’,
‘barreter’ into ‘barrister’, ‘synonymas’ into ‘synonymous’,
‘extempory’ into ‘extemporary’, ‘scited’
into ‘situated’, ‘vancurrier’ into ‘avant-courier’; he
at the same time informs us that for all purposes of the
study of the English language (and few writers are for
this more important than Fuller), he has made his edition
utterly worthless. Or again, when modern editors of
Shakespeare print, and that without giving any intimation
of the fact,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Like quills upon the fretful <i>porcupine</i>”,<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>he having written, and in his first folio and quarto the
words standing,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Like quills upon the fretful <i>porpentine</i>”,<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>this being the earlier, and in Shakespeare’s time the more
common form of the word [e.g. “the <i>purpentines</i> nature”
(Puttenham, <i>Eng. Poesie</i>, 1589, p. 118, ed. Arber)], they
must be considered as taking a very unwarrantable liberty
with his text; and no less, when they substitute ‘Kenilworth’
for ‘Killingworth’, which he wrote, and which was
his, Marlowe’s, and generally the earlier form of the name.</p></div>
